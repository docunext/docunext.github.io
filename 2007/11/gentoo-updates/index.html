There were a couple of hitches:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
* Messages for package net-misc/neon-0.26.3:
* There are new features in this version; please beware that
* upstream considers the socks support experimental.  If you
* experience test failures (eg, bug 135863) then try rebuilding
* glibc. *
* Neon has a policy of breaking API across versions, this means
* that any packages that link against neon will be broken after
* updating. They will remain broken until they are ported to the
* new API. You can downgrade neon to the previous version by doing...
</pre>
<p>The first one, neon, doesn't seem to pose a problem, because I also updated subversion. The second isn't a big deal, because I mostly access the server remote. I also haven't had any problems with kbd though, I just think its odd if failed to emerge.</p>
<p>Also updated an even older gentoo machine, but had some problems with mysql:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
[ERROR] Fatal error: mysql.user table is damaged or in unsupported 3.20 format.
</pre>

</a></p>
<p>The MySQL bit was actually quite a pain, but eventually it worked out. I pretty much had to rebuild the user db, but thankfully I only had a few users - root and an average user. I used:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --user=root &amp;
</pre>
<p>as suggested by John Hunt, but I'm posting it above because his Wordpress is doing funky things to the characters making it hard to cut and paste into a terminal.</p>
<p>It sure is an odd experience managing both gentoo and debian machines, they are so different! Again one of these machines is really old - running a Gentoo install from several years back. The biggest problem with that upgrade is that the machine lost track of the HD ids. No longer able to find
<strong>/dev/sdaX</strong>, I had to rebuild /etc/fstab with the likes of this:</p>
<p><strong>/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1</strong></p>
<p>I did run into some more minor issues too though:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
* This package will overwrite one or more files that may belong to other
* packages (see list below). Add "collision-protect" to FEATURES in
* make.conf if you would like the merge to abort in cases like this. You
* can use a command such as `portageq owners / ` to identify
* the installed package that owns a file. If portageq reports that only
* one package owns a file then do NOT file a bug report. A bug report is
* only useful if it identifies at least two or more packages that are
* known to install the same file(s). If a collision occurs and you can
* not explain where the file came from then you should simply ignore the
* collision since there is not enough information to determine if a real
* problem exists. Please do NOT file a bug report at
* http://bugs.gentoo.org unless you report exactly which two packages
* install the same file(s). Once again, please do NOT file a bug report
* unless you have completely understood the above message.
*  * Detected file collision(s): *  *      /usr/sbin/python-updater
revdep-rebuild -X --library libexpat.so.0
* Any package that linked against the previous version
* of gettext will have to be rebuilt.
* Please 'emerge gentoolkit' and run:
* revdep-rebuild --library libintl.so.7
* PLEASE PLEASE take note of this
* Please make *sure* to run revdep-rebuild now
* Certain things on your system may have linked against a
* different version of com_err -- those things need to be
* recompiled.  Sorry for the inconvenience
* You have had multiple versions of perl. It is recommended
* that you run perl-cleaner now. perl-cleaner will
* assist with this transition. This script is capable
* of cleaning out old .ph files, rebuilding modules for
* your new version of perl, as well as re-emerging
* applications that compiled against your old libperl.so *
* PLEASE DO NOT INTERRUPT THE RUNNING OF THIS SCRIPT.
* Part of the rebuilding of applications compiled against
* your old libperl involves temporarily unmerging
* them - interruptions could leave you with unmerged
* packages before they can be remerged. *
* If you have run perl-cleaner and a package still gives
* you trouble, and re-emerging it fails to correct
* the problem, please check http://bugs.gentoo.org/
* for more information or to report a bug. *  *
</pre>
<p>This one reminds me of the pam / shadow dual-block:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
*
* Your current setup is using the pam_stack module.
* This module is deprecated and no longer supported, and since version
* 0.99 is no longer installed, nor provided by any other package.
* The package will be built (to allow binary package builds), but will
* not be installed.
* Please replace pam_stack usage with proper include directive usage,
* following the PAM Upgrade guide at the following URL
*   http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/pam/upgrade-0.99.xml
</pre>
<p>What I did:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
auth    include      system-auth
account    include      system-auth
password        include      system-auth
session         include      system-auth
</pre>
<p>And this is fine:</p>
<pre>
*  * If you have just upgraded from an older version of python you * will need to run:
*  * /usr/sbin/python-updater
*  * This will automatically rebuild all the python dependent modules * to run with python-2.4.
*  * Your original Python is still installed and can be accessed via * /usr/bin/python2.x. *
</pre>
<p>But I didn't have python-updater, it was blocked by my current version: 2.3.5.
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-4528367.html">This forum thread
</a> helped me figure out what to do:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
emerge --nodeps -v =dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r5
</pre>
<p>Only after that could I emerge -C =dev-land/python-2.3.5 and emerge python-updater.</p>
<p>Running Gentoo is definitely more stressful for me than running debian from time to time, but at the same point, I also find it a bit more satisfying as well, as I fell like I'm more in control and able to make more precise decisions. Its a trade off I guess.</p>
<h4><b>Upgrading linux from 2.4 to 2.6</b></h4>
<p>Told you one of my gentoo machines was old:</p>
<pre>
* You need a kernel of at least version 2.6.9 * for NPTL support! *

<p>Its running 2.4.28-grsec-2.1.0. I'm now updating to a non-grsec kernel : sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.22-r9. I've already switched to a standard profile, and am already using a standard gcc profile, so I
<strong><em>hope</em></strong> it will be OK. I'm not sure exactly what kernel configuration I'll need though, so I'm very thankful that I have this machine hooked up to a KVM over IP box so I can easily choose the original kernel. :-)</p>
<p>I'll probably check to see if I have a config for my 2.4 kernel, but I'm doubtful that it would be friendly to the 2.6 menuconfig. Since I compiled the 2.4 kernel, I've learned a lot about how its done. Gentoo was the platform I really learned how to compile a kernel on my own, but I've since done it many many times on my various debian boxes, to

<a href="http://www.docunext.com//pc_chips_v21g___40__v1.0c__41___via_c7/">via C7 acpi cpufreq capabilities
</a>. Thankfully, they do have a
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/migration-to-2.6.xml" rel="nofollow">Gentoo migration to 2.6 guide
</a>. Most of it doesn't relate to me, but I was glad to read it anyway, at least to learn that make oldconfig won't work.</p>
<p>AWESOME! It worked, I'm now running Gentoo's 2.6.22 kernel. :-)</p></div></div><div><span>Yearly Indexes: </span><span><a href="/2003/"><span>2003</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2004/"><span>2004</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2006/"><span>2006</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2007/"><span>2007</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2008/"><span>2008</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2009/"><span>2009</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2010/"><span>2010</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2011/"><span>2011</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2012/"><span>2012</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2013/"><span>2013</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2015/"><span>2015</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2019/"><span>2019</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2020/"><span>2020</span></a> </span><span><a href="/2022/"><span>2022</span></a> </span></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/2007/11/gentoo-updates/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-9068a959998310636008.js"],"app":["/app-578f356f1ad3d3b2b65e.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js-738961a9611f9aa4e8d4.js"],"component---src-pages-games-react-nuzaq-js":["/component---src-pages-games-react-nuzaq-js-50d5da494a82a1aaeb8b.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-3aa2421409c5653df938.js"],"component---src-pages-years-js":["/component---src-pages-years-js-d36f319c6c16ef9e8314.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-cc8ebf9459c2ce2cf980.js"],"component---src-templates-year-js":["/component---src-templates-year-js-e8af3ddab603f61c6142.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-9068a959998310636008.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-cc8ebf9459c2ce2cf980.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-bbb2797d08d51fd1bd26.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-578f356f1ad3d3b2b65e.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-e27ef662c918f795a5a3.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-910253975eed29c257e8.js" async=""></script></body></html>
