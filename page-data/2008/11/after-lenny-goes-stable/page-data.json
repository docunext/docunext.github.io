I'm not looking forward to it going stable so much that I can use it - I already am! I'm looking forward to it going stable so I'll have to do fewer updates, and I can start using the next version of testing.</p>\n<p>I realize I can use \"Sid\", which is \"unstable\", but I'm not keen on that. I've used it in the past and found it just a tiny bit too unstable for me. If I were more involved with Debian development, I would probably use it, but where I am today it just doesn't make sense to me.</p>\n<p>So when will Lenny go stable? Its hard to say. Since Debian is primarily a volunteer organization, it is not motivated to get new distributions out the door for profit. If I understand correctly, Debian developers are more concerned with quality and security, and these achievements time. I'm hopeful that Lenny gets released before 2009, but that's only two months away.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/after-lenny-goes-stable/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"After Lenny Goes Stable","date":"November 6th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/after-lenny-goes-stable/"}},
