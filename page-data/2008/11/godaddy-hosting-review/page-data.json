For the most part, things have been great, except for one time where I messed up my DNS records, and their support was only interested in selling me more product, not helping me with my problem.</p>\n<p>Since then, as long as I've used them solely as a domain registrant, things have been fine - no complaints at all (although they did recently raise their prices).</p>\n<p>Based on that positive experience, I decided to give their free hosting a try - it comes with along with each domain I think, so all I had to do was use one of my many credits. It took only a moment to setup, and now the account is pending setup (and should be finished in twenty four hours), so once I get it going, I'll have more to write.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here are some more details, which are pretty impressive considering the price, even when its not free:</p>\n<ul><li>10GB of storage</li><li>300GB of traffic</li></ul>This type of deal reminds me of my experience with Dreamhost - they offer so much, but due to server demands its impossible to actually use it all!\n<p>UPDATE: The free hosting account requires the inclusion of ads on the top, duh! That's useless. I guess instead of web pages, it could be used to host graphics.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/godaddy-hosting-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GoDaddy Hosting Review","date":"November 4th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/godaddy-hosting-review/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
