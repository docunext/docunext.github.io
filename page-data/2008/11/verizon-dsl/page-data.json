Mainly because comcast is evil, and I refuse to use their often shoddy service, and FiOS isn't available in my area.</p>\n<p>It treats us really well. My boyfriend play MMORPG's and he never notices a difference when playing. Our only slow down with the DSL is if we're downloading something. We don't do that very often, so it doesn't really impact us. All in all I like my verizon service. I'd be even happier if they'd put the FiOS on this side of rte. 28 though.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/verizon-dsl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Verizon DSL","date":"November 14th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/verizon-dsl/"}}}
