I was very impressed by the user interface, it really makes full use of the touch capabilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/10/the-iphone-is-a-disaster/\">I had previously thought that the iPhone was a disaste</a>r, I now can see, or feel, that its a quality item. I still like my e815 (which I really should get reactivated) too much to think about getting an iPhone, but if iPhone apps like the drum beat sequencer are available for the iPod touch, I might think about getting one of those.</p>\n<p>The app only cost $4.99, which is a great bargain in my opinion.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Its very cool that linux has been ported to the iPhone as well!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/iphone-beats/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone Beats","date":"November 30th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/iphone-beats/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
