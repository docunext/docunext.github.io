Its not the best hosting, but it isn't bad. It comes with 20MB of storage, which is tiny, but for static HTML files, its enough.</p>\n<p>So I've decided to use sitecopy and chronicle as a <a href=\"http://www.established-sites.com/blog/\">content management system</a> for the web hosting sites. Its working pretty good!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/bizzcv2p/\">Welcome to My Verizon Web Space</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/vzfiosisgood/\">Verizon FIOS is Good</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/verizon-hosting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Verizon Hosting","date":"November 13th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/verizon-hosting/"}},
