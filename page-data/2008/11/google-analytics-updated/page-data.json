At first I really liked it, but then I realized that there are still a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.informedusability.com/blog/\">user interface usability issue</a>s - like that the number of rows displayed is never remembered.</p>\n<p>The major difference I noticed is the ability to view percentage changes over the past day, week, month or year for several sites at once. That makes it easier to get a quick glance of what's going on.</p>\n<p>I don't mean to complain - I love Google Analytics. Its pretty amazing that it is available free of charge for low-volume sites. I eventually would like to host my own version of this type of service so that I can retain and further analyze the data, but I just don't have the time to set that up at the moment.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/google-analytics-updated/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google Analytics Updated","date":"November 11th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/11/google-analytics-updated/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
