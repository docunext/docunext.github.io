I had registered the domain via dot5hosting. To transfer the domain, I emailed dot5:</p>\n<blockquote>\nI would like to transfer ischemic.org to another registrar, but do not\nknow my dot5hosting.com login information. Do I manage the domain\nthrough dot5hosting.com or through opensrs.com?\n<p>Otherwise, would it be possible for me to initiate the transfer at\nGoDaddy.com and then get a confirmation code from you?</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/09/thank-you-icann/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thank you ICANN","date":"September 9th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/09/thank-you-icann/"}},
