I'm not sure if its caused by an incompatibility with pfSense and the WRAP, or I'm just getting bad luck with my CF cards. Hmmm. I might need to switch to m0n0wall at some point if the problems persist.</p>\n<p>Today I was thinking of setting up a VOIP phone, but I am not able to setup a switch for the phone to be a part of the VPN - yet!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/09/portable-pfsense-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portable pfSense Update","date":"September 10th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/09/portable-pfsense-update/"}},
