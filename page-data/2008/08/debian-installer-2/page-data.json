I've installed it onto a few machines now, and after a few installations its a breeze.  The majority of installation is self explanatory, although there are a few steps I was unsure of.  The first question being exactly what an LVM is used for and whether or not you should use a mirror. Aside from a few uncertainties I was able to get Debian up and running quickly and painlessly.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/08/debian-installer-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Installer","date":"August 5th, 2008","tags":"debian,lvm"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/08/debian-installer-2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
