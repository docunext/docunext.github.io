During my time with Mac OS X, I used Gentoo for my servers. After struggling with upgrades, I decided to switch to Debian at the suggestion of a colleague.</p>\n<p>I haven't looked back after switching to debian, but now that I'm using linux on the desktop, I'm wondering if I should give gentoo another chance. I find myself constantly wanting to optimize my computing experience!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/02/missing-gentoo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Missing Gentoo","date":"February 12th, 2008","tags":"gentoo,mac"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/02/missing-gentoo/"}},
