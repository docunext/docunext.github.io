Too bad!</p>\n<p>I've tried resetting the PRAM as well as the PMU, with no results. This thread mentions a mainboard issue: <a href=\"http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=429081\">http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=429081</a></p>\n<p>Maybe that is the problem.</p>\n<p>This is actually a major issue, because the Macbook uses the oh-so-convenient Magsafe power cable, which is a bad thing when you have no battery. I guess I'll have to super glue it on or something. Aha - found this page which promises a replacement battery:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/macbook_macbookpro/batteryupdate/\">http://www.apple.com/support/macbook_macbookpro/batteryupdate/</a></p>\n<p>Just finished up at the \"Genius Bar\" and left with a free replacement battery. The Apple Service Representative at first said that since my Mac was out of warranty, I'd have to buy a battery, so I'm glad I printed out the page that said in clear terminology that Macs out of warranty were included in the replacement offer. I'm glad, and a little surprised, that they lived up to their promise.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/02/no-macbook-battery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"No Macbook Battery Icon Just an X","date":"February 13th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/02/no-macbook-battery/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
