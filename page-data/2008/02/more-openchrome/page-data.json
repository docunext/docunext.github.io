Oh well.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hombrepac.com.ar/software-libre/linux/how-to-via-k8m890-chrome-9-igp-and-linuxs-xorg-ubuntu-edgy-610/\">VIA K8M890 Chrome 9 IGP and Linux's Xorg - Ubuntu Edgy 6.10</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-485646.html\">Compiling and Installing the OpenChrome Graphical VIA Driver</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also still getting this error:</p>\n<pre>VIALoadPalette: Function not implemented for this chipset.</pre>\n<p>UPDATE: Strangely enough, I am now able to load the DRI modules - \"drm\" and \"via\" while using the openchrome driver. I still get an error when trying to run glxgears, but it defaults to using software rendering. What's great about this is that I now have accelerated MPEG! :-)</p>\n<pre>(==) CHROME(0): Xv Bandwidth check is enabled.\n(II) CHROME(0):[XvMC] Registering chromeXvMCPro.\n(II) CHROME(0): [XvMC] Initialized XvMC extension.</pre>\n<p>I can have a large VLC window playing in the background while I am browsing interactively in swiftweasel, while my processor is running at 400Mhz... way to go VIA! Now how about opening up that unichrome 3D driver? Huh?</p>\n<p>What fixed it? I'm not exactly sure... as usual I didn't follow a strictly scientific methodology in troubleshooting the problems. Two things that potentially could have helped: * Added load \"GLcore\" to xorg.conf* Recompiled kernel using <a href=\"http://wiki.openchrome.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=P4M900\">agp / drm P4M900 chipset fix as described on the openchrome wiki</a></p>\n<p>I'm thinking it was the agp / drm fix. The openchrome wiki also mentions how confusing drivers for the unichrome hardware can be - I agree! At the moment, my gut is telling me to stick with openchrome, understanding that they are trying out experimental features. To keep this blog post from getting to large, I've started a page about the <a href=\"/wiki/Openchrome\">openchrome</a> drivers in the Docunext wiki.</p>\n<p>I also want to mention how much fun it has been to work with graphics again. I haven't done much work with 3D since I got my first 3D Macintosh software days about 12 years ago. Wow!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/02/more-openchrome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"More Openchrome Battles Less DRI GLX 3D","date":"February 5th, 2008","tags":"3D,openchrome,opengl"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/02/more-openchrome/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
