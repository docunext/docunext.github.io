I'm using a low power laptop with the unichrome pro chipset, the openchrome xserver-xorg driver, and am doing all sorts of senseless fiddling when compiling the kernel, but hey, that's how I learn. Here's more of my notes:</p>\n<p>I've been working on making X perform better,</p>\n<p>and the little tweaks I thought might make a difference only make a slight difference.</p>\n<p>Now I'm trying to recompile with the i686 arch instead of prescott, the kernel</p>\n<p>and the xorg openchrome driver</p>\n<p>I was surprised that NoAccel \"true\" only made the xperf marginally slower...</p>\n<p>I was also surprised that reducing the videoram to 32 from 128 didn't have a noticeable</p>\n<p>affect on x11perf, I supposed it would for more aggressive tasks like 3d,</p>\n<p>but I'm unable to use 3d acceleration anyway.</p>\n<p>I removed via, agp, agpgart, drm, and via-agp modules, to save memory.</p>\n<p>Having a hard time trying to figure out how to pass compiler flags to make-kpkg,</p>\n<p>if possible.</p>\n<p>I'd like to use:-march=i686 -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -msse -mfpmath=sse</p>\n<p>maybe edit the placeholder that pentium-builder made? No that doesn't work</p>\n<p>I set -march with DEBIAN_BUILDHOST, then I found in Makefile there is a spot for CFLAGS...</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/02/x11-xserver-xorg-performance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"X11 xserver xorg performance","date":"February 16th, 2008","tags":"performance,x11"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/02/x11-xserver-xorg-performance/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
