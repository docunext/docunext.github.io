Even the mediocre ones which provided domains for $7.49 are no longer working. Ugh.</p>\n<p>So I did a little searching and found domainspricedright.com, which is godaddy in disguise, but which provides domains for $7.99. Its not bad, but certainly not great. :-(</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/10/no-more-godaddy-coupon-codes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"No More GoDaddy Coupon Codes","date":"October 6th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/10/no-more-godaddy-coupon-codes/"}},
