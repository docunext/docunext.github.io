They make it easy to add an extra network device as well as a private IP address, so after that, I did the usual /etc/racoon/racoon.conf to match up with a pfSense box on the other side, and voila!</p>\n<p>One thing I overlooked was that I only want my single private IP address to be able to connect to my private network, not the entire Linode private IP space! I fixed that, but also need to add more rules to my firewall to make sure that other Linodes are securely blocked from mine.</p>\n<p>This is a great thing because I'm now able to easily expand on my main network.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IPSec VPN on Linode","date":"October 26th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/10/ipsec-vpn-on-linode/"}}}
