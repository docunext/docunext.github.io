Its a TCP relay, which can listen on an ip address and port and relay the transmission to another ip and port, and back again.</p>\n<p>Why is this useful? I'm using it as a simple way to replace <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2008/10/static-nat-over-ipsec/\">NAT over a VPN</a>, which I just couldn't get to work. More specifically, I have <a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2008/08/fios-is-nice.html\">Verizon FIOS</a>, and since, in my opinion, <a href=\"http://www.cabotplace.net/blog/2008/04/business-fios-review.html\">Verizon charges way too much for IP addresses</a>, I only requested one. How can I route additional IP address to services behind a firewall on the FIOS IP address? With the use of a VPN which can connect a remote system to the LAN, and then relay the public IP on the remote system to a private IP on the other end of the VPN LAN. Yes, its that simple.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what type of security or performance issues might be encountered, so I'm planning to doing some testing. In the meantime, your thoughts and feedback are appreciated!</p>\n<p>More information:\n<a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Rinetd page at Docunext</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/10/rinetd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rinetd","date":"October 25th, 2008","tags":"fios,tcp,vpn"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/10/rinetd/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
