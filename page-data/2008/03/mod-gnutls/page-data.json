I installed it on a debian lenny machine without any problems - I'm even using my own self-signed certificate. :-)</p>\n<p>What I'm really excited about is its support for SNI:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_gnutls/sni/\">http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_gnutls/sni/</a></p>\n<p>Yay! I just tried it out and it works! At least with Firefox 3, haven't tried anything else out yet....</p>\n<p>So mod_gnutls is in testing, but its an older version. There is another much newer version in sid, but I'm not going there yet. It looks like its actively managed so I won't stress it.</p>\n<p>I'm probably not expressing the significance of this tool - its huge! The ability to serve SSL virtual hosts on a single IP addess is phenomenal.</p>\n<p>Problems:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">[Fri Mar 28 20:28:05 2008] [error] GnuTLS: Hanshake Alert (20) 'Bad record MAC'.\n[Fri Mar 28 20:28:05 2008] [error] [client 192.168.1.174] GnuTLS: Handshake Failed (-12) 'A TLS fatal alert has been received.'</pre>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">[Fri Mar 28 19:40:32 2008] [error] GnuTLS: Hanshake Alert (10) 'Unexpected message'.\n[Fri Mar 28 19:40:32 2008] [error] [client 192.168.1.174] GnuTLS: Handshake Failed (-12) 'A TLS fatal alert has been received.'\n[Fri Mar 28 19:49:09 2008] [notice] child pid 1711 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)</pre>\n<p>I finagled 0.5.1 onto my server from sid and its working great!
