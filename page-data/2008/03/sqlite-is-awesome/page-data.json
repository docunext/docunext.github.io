Previously I had been using only MySQL. Several weeks ago I tried to get PBooks and SQLite to go, but it wasn't happening. Since then, I've been working on <a href=\"http://www.phunkybb.com/\">PhunkyBB</a>, and I've been using a SQLite database for development. That has taught me a lot about it - previously I had only used SQLite for Trac, but I eventually switched to MySQL so that it could be replicated.</p>\n<p>SQLite seems like the perfect data storage system for local desktop usage. I love the fact that Firefox is using it as well as GnuCash. I hope GNOME and more of the GNU gang start to embrace SQLite as a data storage mechanism.</p>\n<p>I could foresee /etc and ~/.config getting stored in a SQLite database, and even backed up / replicated to a network RDBMS like MySQL or Postgres.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to working more with SQLite - including figuring out the big differences between version 2 and 3. PBooks only works with 2 as MDB2 only works with 2.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/03/sqlite-is-awesome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SQLite Is Awesome","date":"March 11th, 2008","tags":"firefox,mysql,sqlite"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/03/sqlite-is-awesome/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
