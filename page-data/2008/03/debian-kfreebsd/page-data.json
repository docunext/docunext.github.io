The installation process is much more FreeBSD than debian, but once you get into the running shell, its all apt-get. Only main is available, no contrib or non-free, but with main I was able to install x-window-system and openbox.  The screen is really fuzzy though, but I can't install hwinfo to get xdebconfigurator.</p>\n<p>Now I'm installing xfce4 to see how that goes.... that worked OK, and now I'm using vesa which is much better, but slower.</p>\n<p>I can't get iceweasel to work so its installing galeon now. It wouldn't install because mono-common relied on update-binfmt which only works on linux. I commented out the exit 2; line just so it would install, and it worked. I was able to start up galeon.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/03/debian-kfreebsd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debian kFreeBSD","date":"March 25th, 2008","tags":"debian,freebsd,xfce4"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/03/debian-kfreebsd/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
