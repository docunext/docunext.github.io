Duh!</p>\n<p>OK, there is probably a helper to create the list... hmmmm. Maybe md5sums isn't necessary. I had my DEBIAN folder setup wrong, and I just found this page about <a href=\"http://quietsche-entchen.de/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/CreatingDebianPackages\" rel=\"nofollow\">creating debian</a> packages which says its optional.</p>\n<p>Trying again... aha! Turns out the problem was that dh-make-php only supports the old version of package.xml - version 1.0. That's too bad. Thankfully I was able to create one thanks to dfm.</p>\n<p>The goal for me in setting up package files is to be able to type \"debian/rules binary\" and have it produce the package for me.
