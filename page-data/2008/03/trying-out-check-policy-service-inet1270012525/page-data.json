It looks pretty good. I'm willing to try something new (I use postgrey in production) as I'm setting up a backup MX.</p>\n<p>While I'm at it, I'm also examining postfix-cdb.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I finally got postfix-gld to work, the hang-up was my own dumb typo, but its working now. It looks good too, I think it will make managing greylisting a lot easier, especially when it comes to multiple SMTP hosts. It would be nice if there was the option to set a different host for reads and writes, so that MySQL replicants could be used, but maybe that will be an excuse for me to explore MySQL proxy some more.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/03/trying-out-check-policy-service-inet1270012525/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trying out check policy service inet 127.0.0.1 2525","date":"March 19th, 2008","tags":"cdb,mysql,postfix,proxies,smtp"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/03/trying-out-check-policy-service-inet1270012525/"}},
