Its in Debian's Lenny (testing) distro, so I installed it on my testing server, bart, and gave it a go. Bart is a ve, and unbound had issues with its network setup, so I had to specify the ip address of the ve. I'm also trying out power dns on that machine, so I stopped it during my tests of unbound.</p>\n<h4>Unbound Gotchas</h4>\n<p>When I set the ip address in the unbound conf file to the interface address instead of the loopback address, I was unable to use dig to query the server. Instead it reported this:</p>\n<pre>;; global options:  printcmd;; Got answer:;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: REFUSED, id: 26353;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 0, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available;; Query time: 0 msec;; SERVER: 192.168.8.111#53(192.168.8.111);; WHEN: Wed Jul  9 09:34:42 2008;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 12</pre>\n<h4>Resolver or Server?</h4>\n<p>Looks like Unbound is mainly a resolver, like a front-end for a DNS management system backend. I could see how it would make sense to have unbound of the front lines, and something like Power DNS of MyDNS on the back end.</p>\n<p>Changing it to 127.0.0.1 and pointing the dig to localhost did the trick. I'm surprised by that, if I end up using this new server, I'll have to figure out how to publish the service to an interface besides the loopback.</p>\n<p>Still not sure, but I think the answer is that it is designed to be used as both a server and caching resolver.</p>\n<h4>Off Topic</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jigsawmusicgroup.com/blog/2008/07/09/crystal-method/\">Bound too long by the Crystal Method is a great song!</a></p>\n<p>UPDATE: I'm now using <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">NSD3</a>, and it is excellent!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/07/unbound-dns-server/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unbound DNS Server","date":"July 9th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/07/unbound-dns-server/"}},
