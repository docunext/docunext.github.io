I did a bunch of tests and stuff\nseems to work well. Can you give an example of what an action would\nlook like? In nexista I'd do something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_xml\">\n&lt;map:action type=\"redirect\" params=\"/new-url/\"/>\n</pre>\n<p>Would data sources be accessed via action components? And what about</p>\n<p>python scripts? Would it be possible to include a script in a pipeline</p>\n<p>match? In nexista I'd do this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_xml\">\n&lt;map:script src=\"lib/simple_script.php\"/>\n</pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Questions about Pycoon","date":"January 1st, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/questions-about-pycoon/"}}}
