The trac hack I edited is the sitemaps plugin, which generates an XML sitemap document for use with search engines. I had it working with trac 0.10.4 but since I upgraded to 0.11 the compatibility broke.</p>\n<p>The first problem was with the timestamps. The wiki api changed, and it took a long time to figure out how to fix this. The problem was converting a datetime format to a timestamp, and then converting that back to a datetime format compatible with the sitemaps specification.</p>\n<p>After that, I had to figure out how to build the right URLs, which wasn't too hard. The trac web href module made that simple enough.</p>\n<p>TODO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish my changes</li>\n<li>Figure out what's up with the egg format</li>\n<li>Fix the admin ui (not working atm)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hooray Successful Trac Edits","date":"January 7th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/hooray-successful-trac-edits/"}}}
