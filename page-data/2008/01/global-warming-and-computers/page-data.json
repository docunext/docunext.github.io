Its enough to encourage me turn off machines to save a few dollars a month, but compared to heat and air conditioning, its not too much, as far as I can tell. In addition to that, there is a significant expense in the transmission of electricity to my home and office, so even if a computer doesn't use that much power, there is also power consumed in getting the power there.</p>\n<p>Since getting power to computers requires power, its another reason why I like the idea of solar powered computers. But the problem with that is that you'd of course need a power supply for the night time.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Global Warming and Computers","date":"January 20th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/global-warming-and-computers/"}}}
