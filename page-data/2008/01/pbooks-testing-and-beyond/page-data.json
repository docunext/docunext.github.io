It has been a good experience, I have learned a lot through manual testing, test suites, and the use of the Selenium IDE.  Testing is vital when it comes to designing a new website or making a new program.  When you correct one thing, something else may break.  You also have to test hundreds of combinations as if you were a new user, in order to make sure all aspects of the program or website work properly.</p>\n<p>My experience with PBooks has given me a good understanding of the testing process.  I wouldn't say that testing is difficult, but there is a lot more to it than one may think.  I am looking forward to using these skills on future projects.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/01/pbooks-testing-and-beyond/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pbooks Testing and Beyond","date":"January 25th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/pbooks-testing-and-beyond/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
