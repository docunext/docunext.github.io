It should have been obvious, but I was thinking too deep.</p>\n<p>Selenium reads the HTML output, not the text of the source. So to create a newline for a textarea, you have to use &#x3C;br/>!</p>\n<p>This reminds me that the other day I tried creating a dynamic test with a PHP file and of course it worked fine. I should also be able to create the test with XSL, which would be terrific.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/01/selenium-test-newline-textarea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Selenium Test Newline Textarea","date":"January 16th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/selenium-test-newline-textarea/"}},
