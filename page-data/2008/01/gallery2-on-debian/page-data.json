I had to enter a mysql username and password for the apt-get install.</p>\n<p>Then I loaded up the webserver where g2 is hosted and it brought me to the installation process. I had to verify / authenticate by putting a file on the server for it, not a problem.</p>\n<p>Wow, I'm impressed with the installer. It prompter me to setup a web directory, a storage directory, and allowed all this to work for a multisite setup. That is very very cool.</p>\n<p>The one thing I'm a little skeptical of is the affiliate commerce sections which come pre-populated with affiliate ids. It would be nice to know who the affiliate is, and how to reconfigure the relationships.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/01/gallery2-on-debian/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gallery2 on Debian","date":"January 5th, 2008","tags":"debian,php"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/01/gallery2-on-debian/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
