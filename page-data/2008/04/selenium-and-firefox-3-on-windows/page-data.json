I was having a heck of a time getting the tests to pass.  The tests would run into all sorts of problems, and then about a third of the way through, I would get a message saying Selenium failure.</p>\n<p>I then downloaded the beta version of Firefox 3, and then attempted to run through the tests using the core. The tests ran much smoother and selenium managed to make its way through the suite without the failure error.  Nine of the tests still failed.  All but two of the tests failed on the same step.  assertElementPresent  \tcontent  \tfalse.  The functioning CSV import test failed on the following step click  \tid=functions  \tElement id=functions not found.  And the core account balances step failed here clickAndWait  \t//a[@id='functions']  \tElement //a[@id='functions'] not found.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/04/selenium-and-firefox-3-on-windows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Selenium and Firefox 3 on Windows","date":"April 29th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/selenium-and-firefox-3-on-windows/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
