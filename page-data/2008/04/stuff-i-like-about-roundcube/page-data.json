I've manually implemented it in Wordpress, though there are a few glitches and its more complicated than it needs to be.</p>\n<p>Another thing I like about RoundCube is the user interface.

Its simple, appealing, and very user friendly.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/04/stuff-i-like-about-roundcube/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stuff I Like about RoundCube","date":"April 1st, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/stuff-i-like-about-roundcube/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
