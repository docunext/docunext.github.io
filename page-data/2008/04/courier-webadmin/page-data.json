The apache2 server I was trying to install it on had a VirtualScriptAlias setup for trac fastcgi, and I couldn't get courier webadmin to work without removing it.</p>\n<p>Courierwebadmin is different than most web apps I've used before. There is a binary elf interface to to perl scripts and html templates on the back end.</p>\n<p>Once I got it to work, I realized I didn't really need it. It might be helpful for setting up esmtp stuff, but I use postfix for that. Speaking of which I just started a new project <a href=\"http://www.chimailmadmin.com/blog/\">Chimailmadmin</a>. Its inspired by the original postfixadmin and uses <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">Nexista</a> as the framework.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/04/courier-webadmin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trying our the Courier Email Project Webadmin on Debian GNU Linux","date":"April 20th, 2008","tags":"courier,\"systems administration\",webmail"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/courier-webadmin/"}},
