Nice.</p>\n<p>I'm really happy that Sun has decided to release their operating system under the\n<del>GPL\n</del> CDDL. I've heard very good things about Sun and Solaris but its always been just out of my reach.</p>\n<h4>My experience with Nexenta\n</h4>\n<p>My initial experience was great- the install went fine - apt-get update, yup. The problems started when I tried to login remotely via ssh. It prompts me for my usename, says its entering interactive mode, and hangs... forever.</p>\n<p>Oh well. I found\n<a href=\"http://www.livibetter.com/blog/2007/07/11/ssh-takes-exactly-1-minute-20-seconds-or-80-seconds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this\n</a> which seemed like it was going to help, but alas, it did not.</p>\n<p>I feel like I'm missing something incredibly obvious.</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive).\ndebug1: channel 0: new [client-session]\ndebug1: Entering interactive session.\n</pre>\n<p>It feels like a blocked process - like the kernel / os is waiting for something, and won't allow the process to move forward. Hmmm. I guess its a network driver bug for the chip on the d201gly - I got ssh working by adding a USB nic. The driver causing the problems is \"sfe\".</p>\n<p>The one that works is a belkin usb nic, driver \"upf\".</p>\n<p>A couple things which helped:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://solaris-x86.org/documents/tutorials/network.mhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://solaris-x86.org/documents/tutorials/network.mhtml</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rite-group.com/rich/solaris_dhcp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rite-group.com/rich/solaris_dhcp.html\n</a></p>\n<p>This is pretty cool:</p>\n</a>\n<p>I tried installing phpsysinfo on top of apache2 and it runs but I get many errors:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARNING: The SunOS version of phpSysInfo is work in progress, some things currently don't work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is kind of cool too:</p>\n</a>\n<p>The filesystems layout is different than both linux and freebsd it seems. I've heard good things about zfs so I'm very curious.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I've got moinmoin installed so I can really test out the platform.</p>\n<p>More notes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Nexenta Notes at Docunext\n</a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nexenta","date":"April 16th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/nexenta/"}}}
