This is mostly for practice at this point, and I'm going to sign it and upload it to the mentors server just to go through the motions.</p>\n<p>There have been some posts on planet debian about lack of involvement by debian developers (like that 4 months have gone by without a new developer being elected, even though there are many ready to be), and for probably justified reasons, there are many many hurdles and hoops to jump through to get packages uploaded, sponsored, and added to the repository.</p>\n<p>I want to go through the motions so I can learn how they do it - I've already learned a bunch by having to create a GPG public key so sign up at mentors.debian.net.</p>\n<p>But... I've never been a good team player. I wish I could be, but I know myself enough to know I'm terrible at it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the process of uploading to debian - the next steps mention .changes and .dsc files. I've never heard of these before - but I'm reading up on them and am realized I was wondering about them already. Here's the .dsc file that's included with the php-cache-lite package:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\nHash: SHA1\n\nFormat: 1.0\n\nSource: php-cache-lite\n\nVersion: 1.7.2-2\n\nBinary: php-cache-lite\n\nMaintainer: Charles Fry <cfry@debian.org>\n\nArchitecture: all\n\nStandards-Version: 3.7.2\n\nBuild-Depends: dh-make-php (>= 0.1.1), debhelper (>= 5), cdbs\n\nFiles: bec59ae772aa4f306fd9908bba5d4018 29055 php-cache-lite_1.7.2.orig.tar.gz 91e671b99fbfd0a78c9ab92558f3262f 1431 php-cache-lite_1.7.2-2.diff.gz-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQFErIU5hiAFUap5uRoRAia8AKCPhE5bOW3jMTmvfUtRlhxdU+huWQCcDZtI\n\nY/CtYaC8fCdcYPfuSC9oyCk==oBam-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</pre>\n<p>Odd, but the php-cache-lite source package doesn't have a .changes file. It has a diff file, but I'm not sure if that's the same.</p>\n<p>Maybe I can use dpkg-source or dpkg-genchanges? Now I'm working with dpkg-buildpage, installing build-essential at the moment.</p>\n<p>Cool - dpkg-buildpackage was what I needed to use to create the .changes and .dsc file correctly. I'm going to upload them to mentors now, I'm sure I did something wrong but I'm going to go through the motions anyway.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\ndj-smurf-master-mcmonster@dev-101:~$ dupload -t mentors php-nexista_0.2.2_i386.changes\ndupload note: no announcement will be sent.\nChecking signatures before upload......signatures are ok\nUploading (ftp) to mentors.debian.net:/[ job php-nexista_0.2.2_i386 from php-nexista_0.2.2_i386.changes php-nexista_0.2.2.tar.gz, md5sum ok php-nexista_0.2.2.dsc, md5sum ok php-nexista_0.2.2_all.deb, md5sum ok php-nexista_0.2.2_i386.changes ok ]\nUploading (ftp) to mentors (mentors.debian.net)+ FTP passive mode selected[ Uploading job php-nexista_0.2.2_i386 php-nexista_0.2.2.tar.gz 67.9 kB, ok (1 s, 67.85 kB/s) php-nexista_0.2.2.dsc 0.5 kB, ok (1 s, 0.52 kB/s) php-nexista_0.2.2_all.deb 71.3 kB, ok (1 s, 71.26 kB/s) php-nexista_0.2.2_i386.changes 0.9 kB, ok (0 s, 0.86 kB/s) ]</pre>\n<p>Note - for those of you wondering what NMU means (like me), NMU = non-maintainer upload, I guess that's when someone who didn't make the package uploaded it to mentors?</p>\n<p>Here's the link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mentors.debian.net/cgi-bin/maintainer-packages?action=rfs;package=php-nexista\">http://mentors.debian.net/cgi-bin/maintainer-packages?action=rfs;package=php-nexista</a></p>\n<p>I'll have to re-subscribe to the mentors list so I can send an RFS email like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear mentors,</p>\n<p>I am looking for a sponsor for my package \"php-nexista\".* Package name    : php-nexista  Version         : 0.2.2  Upstream Author : [fill in name and email of upstream]* URL             : [fill in URL of upstreams web site]* License         : [fill in]  Section         : web</p>\n<p>It builds these binary packages:</p>\n<p>php-nexista - PHP Development Toolkit</p>\n<p>The package can be found on mentors.debian.net:- URL: <a href=\"http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/p/php-nexista-\">http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/p/php-nexista-</a> Source repository: deb-src <a href=\"http://mentors.debian.net/debian\">http://mentors.debian.net/debian</a> unstable main contrib non-free- dget <a href=\"http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/p/php-nexista/php-nexista_0.2.2.dsc\">http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/p/php-nexista/php-nexista_0.2.2.dsc</a></p>\n<p>I would be glad if someone uploaded this package for me.</p>\n<p>Kind regards Albert L.
