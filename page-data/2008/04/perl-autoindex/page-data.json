While debugging, I also found Apache::OpenIndex.</p>\n<p>Hmmm, this is not working out... it seems like both AutoIndex and OpenIndex only work with apache 1.3.</p>\n<p>AWESOME: This is what I was looking for:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~nicolaw/Apache2-AutoIndex-XSLT-0.03/lib/Apache2/AutoIndex/XSLT.pm\">http://search.cpan.org/~nicolaw/Apache2-AutoIndex-XSLT-0.03/lib/Apache2/AutoIndex/XSLT.pm</a></p>\n<p>This is exactly what I was looking for.
