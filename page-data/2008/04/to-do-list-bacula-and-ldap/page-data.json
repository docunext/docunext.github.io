I think I got it working. So the very cool part about this is the the 'nss_updatedb ldap passwd\" does exactly what I'd hoped it would do. Its not a cache, its a local copy. Cool!</p>\n<p>Actually nss_update is only for passwd and group, so that leaves shadow. It is suggested in the nss_updatedb README that libpam_ccreds can be used for that function.</p>\n<p>More notes here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/LDAP\">LDAP Notes at Docunext</a></p>\n<p><strong>To-do list:</strong> * Improve admin security * Stop using debconf for libnss_ldap.conf and pam_ldap.conf and instead use csync2?* Ensure replication across VPNs</p>\n<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>\n<p>The progress is going well. Migrating additional machines after the first few is quite easy. I'm a little concerned about disconnected access, but I guess if the machine is disconnected, I wouldn't be able to ssh in anyway.</p>\n<h4>Bacula / Backups</h4>\n<p>John Goerzen has a great post about the latest and greatest backup utilities:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://changelog.complete.org/posts/706-Backup-Software.html\"><a href=\"http://changelog.complete.org/posts/706-Backup-Software.html\">http://changelog.complete.org/posts/706-Backup-Software.html</a></a></p>\n<p>I've tried duplicity and wasn't thrilled, but dar sounds awesome.</p>\n<p>UPDATE April 14, 2008 - I just realized that John Goerzen is the author of offlineimap - that's awsome! I love that program. :-)</p>\n<p>This looks pretty good too:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.backup-manager.org/\"><a href=\"http://www2.backup-manager.org/\">http://www2.backup-manager.org/</a></a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/04/to-do-list-bacula-and-ldap/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"To Do List Bacula and LDAP","date":"April 13th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/to-do-list-bacula-and-ldap/"}},
