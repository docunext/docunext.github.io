One question though: when it starts up, there is text that says copyright Sun Microsystems, usage subject to license terms. It doesn't say what those terms are, though. GPL v2, I presume?</p>\n<p>I liked that the liveCD gives you the choice of using XFCE, KDE, or Compiz - surprising. Totally cool.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/04/belenix/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"BeleniX","date":"April 15th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/04/belenix/"}},
