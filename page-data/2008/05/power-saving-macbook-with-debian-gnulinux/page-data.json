I took a look at some pictures of the inside of a Macbook, and it looks like the wifi is there, and maybe the graphics controller? So now I'm trying to reduce the power consumed by the graphics controller, to reduce heat. I've changed the default depth to 16 from 24, and disabled DRI. Hopefully that will help. The lesswatts.org website mentions framebuffer compression, but not how to enable it. Just checked my Xorg logs, looks like its enabled already:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log -n 1000 | grep compression(**) intel(0): Framebuffer compression enabled</pre>\n<p>NOTE: Disabling DRI caused x to crash for me.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/05/power-saving-macbook-with-debian-gnulinux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power Saving Macbook with Debian GNU Linux","date":"May 15th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/05/power-saving-macbook-with-debian-gnulinux/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
