The spec seemed to suggest it was possible, but I couldn't to get it to work properly. I just wrote this back to the list for what its worth:</p>\n<blockquote>\nIf this is indeed a follow-up to my question way back when about mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, and digest authentication, I was unable to find a real solution. What I ended up doing was excluding the digest authentication from proxying, and instead doing it on the forward facing server (the one doing the proxying).\n<p>This worked because the back-end pages were accessible without authentication, but they used http_auth values to identify users for non-apache based authorization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/05/trac-apache-proxies-and-digest-auth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trac Apache Proxies and Digest Auth","date":"May 28th, 2008","tags":"apache,authentication,proxies"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/05/trac-apache-proxies-and-digest-auth/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
