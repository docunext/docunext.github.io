I've <em>lightly</em> used perl for a couple of years, and only recently sat down and read a book about python. I liked it, but couldn't find time to use it enough to get some traction. I wrote a couple of scripts, started but have yet to finish using a project with it. WSGI really caught my attention before I got distracted by something else.</p>\n<p>My recent foray with perl and mod<em>perl has reminded me a lot of the book I read on python, and the stuff I learned about WSGI. I kind of feel like the relationship between perl and apache bridged by mod</em>perl is similar to the relationship between WSGI apps, middleware and servers - that is very cool!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/perl-and-python-old-pals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Perl and Python Old Pals","date":"June 19th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/perl-and-python-old-pals/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
