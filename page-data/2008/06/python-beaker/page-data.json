I get the feeling though that SQLAlchemy makes databases \"pythonic\", kind of like how lxml handles libxml2. I haven't bought into that concept yet, I'm a big fan of SQL \"as-is\", in my opinion there is no need to change it at the moment.</p>\n<p>Chances are I'll continue with adoDB (actually its working fine for me now), then try out SQLRelay, then try SQLAlchemy.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/python-beaker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python Beaker","date":"June 29th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/python-beaker/"}}}
