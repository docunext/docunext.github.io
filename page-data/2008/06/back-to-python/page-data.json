So many people have told me about how it \"makes sense\", but when I try to use it, it seems very arbitrary. I guess its that I'm not a classically trained programmer (or trained at all for that matter), because the debug-as-you-code methods possible with php and to some extent perl suit me well.</p>\n<p>Not one to give up, I've been hammering away with python. I do like how its easier to read. I have trouble with how the modules work though, as well as imports and the dot notation used to navigate paths. Oh well, I've been able to trial-and-error it well enough to get by.</p>\n<p>Now I'm wondering what I should use for a database abstraction layer? AdoDB? SQL Alchemy? I don't really want a full object persistence layer, I think that's what SQL Alchemy is all about.... any suggestions?</p>\n<h4>AdoDB for python</h4>\n<p>I'm making a little headway with this. Big surprise - no built in or handy function for converting between a python dict and a simple xml string. Too bad! There are many python functions out there, but its not really worth it for my purposes. Another snafu is that the MySQL driver uses %s to bind parameters instead of ?. Odd.</p>\n<h4>SQLRelay</h4>\n<p>I still have to try SQLRelay.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/back-to-python/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to Python","date":"June 26th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/back-to-python/"}}}
