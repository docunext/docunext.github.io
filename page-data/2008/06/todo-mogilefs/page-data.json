It appears to be equivalent to the S3 service from Amazon in the way that I would use it. I'd like to store all \"big\" files in a managed fashion. They are bulky and I think it will be easier to manage them separately. Blobstreaming seems like a good idea, as does S3, but blobstreaming doesn't look quite ready, and S3 costs money. Not a lot, but some. Considering how much I've invested in infrastructure, it doesn't make sense to use S3.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://osterman.com/wordpress/2007/06/03/mogilefs-howto\">http://osterman.com/wordpress/2007/06/03/mogilefs-howto</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2007/5/23/#200705232\">http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2007/5/23/#200705232</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/todo-mogilefs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TODO MogileFS","date":"June 18th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/todo-mogilefs/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
