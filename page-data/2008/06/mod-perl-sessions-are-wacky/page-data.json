I don't mind as its helping me learn perl! :-)</p>\n<p>Anyway, its pretty incredible how many flexible perl is, almost too flexible - it looses shape a little bit! I've latched onto Apache::Session, but it has only been bearable thanks to Session, an OOP wrapper.</p>\n<p>Methinks that there should be a better Apache2::Session, but in the meantime this works. Its roundabout for sure - I'm using the Session package to wrap around Apache::Session, with Apache2::Cookie being used to track and maintain the session. Furthermore, Session uses the API of Apache::Session::Flex, which isn't very clear. :-( I'm not sure it it supports file based locking?</p>\n<p>You do have very granular control though, which I guess is a plus.</p>\n<p>Besides the wacky sessions (I'm used to PHP sessions which are about as simple as they come), mod_perl is really awesome.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/mod-perl-sessions-are-wacky/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"mod perl sessions are wacky","date":"June 15th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/mod-perl-sessions-are-wacky/"}},
