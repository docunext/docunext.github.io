I'd like to do something like this:</p>\n<pre>\nPFSENSE -- VARNISH -- APACHE2 / NGINX </pre>\n<p>That way, I can firewall and failover with pfSense, cache with Varnish (maybe even failover and/or load balance too?), serve dynamic content with Apache2, and static content with Nginx.</p>\n<p>HA! I just realized that since I'm already using pfSense as my firewall it was a trivial task to point the load balancer to port 6081 instead of port 80, and point varnish to port 80 instead of 8080. I'm now running varnish in production! :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/06/varnish-reverse-proxy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"In My Opinion Using the Varnish Reverse Proxy with Apache2 pfSense and NGINX Is Good","date":"June 18th, 2008","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/06/varnish-reverse-proxy/"}},
