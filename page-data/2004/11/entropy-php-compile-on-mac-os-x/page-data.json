The build dir needs to be in Desktop/Sandbox/MACOSXPHP/ which is lame.</p>\n<p>Now compiling on the laptop and it cant find the mysql header files. Using fink to install mysql-client, which requires a ton of other stuff.</p>\n<p>Needed Sablotron, so I'm compiling that now manually, didn't like the expat that came I downloaded, so now I'm using the one that fink installed, which it seems to be alright with.</p>\n<p>That seemed to work OK. Actually no it didn't work. Wow this is painful, mostly because I did it in a rush. Was using the extras from the php5 build. Let's hope this works now. Now Sablot it working, mysql is not. Installed new Mysql and am hoping for the best.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2004/11/entropy-php-compile-on-mac-os-x/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Entropy PHP Compile on Mac OS X","date":"November 11th, 2004","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2004/11/entropy-php-compile-on-mac-os-x/"}},
