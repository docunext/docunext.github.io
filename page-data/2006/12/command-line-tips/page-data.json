For example if you're on the desktop ls will show each folder on the desktop.</p>\n<p>ls -la - will give a detailed list of the files in the current directory</p>\n<p>cd directory name here - changes the directory. now's a good time to hit pwd you'll see you'll see you're in a new directory</p>\n<p>cd .. - returns you to the previous directory</p>\n<p>mkdir - creates a new folder in the current directory</p>\n<p>rmdir - will delete files only if they are empty.</p>\n<p>rm -rf - Will force delet if a folder contains other materials</p>\n<p>control c - will stop a function</p>\n<p>control z - will send it to the background</p>\n<p>fg - brings the afore mentioned back to the fore ground</p>\n<p>nano  - brings up a text editor.

These letters indicates the privalages for the individual user, the group, and the owner.</p>\n<p>W means someting is writable.</p>\n<p>R means it is readable.</p>\n<p>X means it is executable.</p>\n<p>Using chmod and a series of 4 numbers you can change the privelags for the file.  \"The first digit  selects       the  set  user  ID (4) and set group ID (2) and sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third       selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values.
