My favorite browser, Camino, has more support than I knew! I just found pimpmycamino.com, which hosts icons, scripts, and add-ons for Camino. Unfortunately, I still can't find a version of the Google Toolbar supported by Camino and it doesn't look like its possible. :-(</p>\n<p>Camino is the Mac OS X native version of Mozilla, which Firebox is based upon. It is native in that it has a direct connect with Apple Macintosh's keychain, and also uses Apple Macintosh's Quartz text rendering system. It also features some great features like ad blocking.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/12/pimp-my-camino/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pimp My Camino","date":"December 23rd, 2006","tags":"camino,google,mac,mozilla"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/12/pimp-my-camino/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
