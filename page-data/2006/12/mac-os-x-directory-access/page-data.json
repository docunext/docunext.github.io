If you can connect and authenticate via LDAP, you are that much closer to the much coveted single sign-on. I've tinkered around with this on my Macbook and my Powermac, but yesterday when I setup firewall logging on the office server, I noticed many connections from my home IP address to port 389 - the ldap port! I had forgotten that I still had directory access enabled, even though I wasn't using it. It was setup for authentication as well as contacts, so I have to imagine it was generating a lot of unecessary traffic. I disabled it via the Utilities -> Directory Access panel, and now my terminal windows open SO much faster. Yee-haw!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/12/mac-os-x-directory-access/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac OS X Directory Access","date":"December 10th, 2006","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/12/mac-os-x-directory-access/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
