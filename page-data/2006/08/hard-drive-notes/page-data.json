Ouch. I pulled the jumper and it started up fine, so now we're running at twice the speed: 3Gbit/s. Transfers over 1000Mbit Cat5 cables to my Dual G5 Power Mac are the same speed, however I bet this is due to the write speed of the SATA drive in my Mac:</p>\n<p>My Mac's SATA 1.0 Drive:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.seagate.com/cda/products/discsales/marketing/detail/0,1081,585,00.html\">Seagate</a></p>\n<p>My Mac Specs:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lowendmac.com/ppc/g5-b.html\">Dual G5 Desktop Powermac @ Lowendmac.com</a></p>\n<p>Doesn't matter though, there may be multiple people accessing the server at the same time.

I think I'd have to bond the cards together.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hard Drive Notes","date":"August 13th, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/08/hard-drive-notes/"}}}
