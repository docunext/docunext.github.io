One of course being the OpenVPN website itself.</p>\n<p>I am using tun instead of tap. From what I gathered, tun allows you to use NAT instead of bridging, which is what TAP uses.</p>\n<p>Tun is a virtual device like eth0. So whenI set this up, I had to edit my firewall and network address translation (NAT) / ip_masquerade rules to provide for the new device. So far things are looking good.</p>\n<p>One thing that really impresses me about OpenVPN is its speed. It is very fast!</p>\n<p>The configuration can be a little tricky, thought I think with some planning and thinking, we can get clients connected easily. * When I connected to OpenVPN from home over this past weekend, I accidentally took down the LAN. Was it because tun0-00 had the same ip # as the LAN gateway - eth1? Stopping the OpenVPN fixed the problem.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/openvpn-documentation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"OpenVPN Documentation","date":"May 1st, 2006","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/05/openvpn-documentation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
