It is either: * mod<em>vhost</em>alias* php</p>\n<p>Actually, it was \"Allow\".</p>\n<p>In my Apache configuration, I had allow all and deny none. I read up on the manual for the allow directive, and it turns out that it will do a reverse dns entry to find out if you have the \"allow\" or \"none\" names! So I changes all to 0.0.0.0, and remove the nones. Works awesome! No more useless dns requests!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/11/tcpdump-notes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TCPDump Notes","date":"November 14th, 2006","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/11/tcpdump-notes/"}}}
