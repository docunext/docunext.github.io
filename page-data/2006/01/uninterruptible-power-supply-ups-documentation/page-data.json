However, like most things, they require planning and forethought.</p><h3 id=\"toc1\">Things to consider when buying a UPS: </h3>\n<ul>    <li>What is the power consumption of the device I would like to provide with uninterruptible power? </li>    <li>How long does it need to run with grid power for? </li></ul><h3 id=\"toc2\">UPS Gotchas: </h3>\n<ul>    <li>The VA (voltage amperes) and the Wattage ratings for UPS's is important! If your device uses MORE than the UPS can provide, it won't work. I used to think it would work, but for a shorter period of time, but it doesn't. </li></ul><h3 id=\"toc3\">UPS Reminders:</h3>\n<ul>    <li>Before you go out and buy a UPS, do some research. You will be glad you did. </li>    <li>Find one that has a USB supported by linux. That will allow you to do much more than you ever imagined. :-)</li></ul><p>The UPS I use is an APC. I'm glad with the purchase because debian has a .deb package for an APC monitoring daemon: apcupsd-cgi.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/01/uninterruptible-power-supply-ups-documentation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Uninterruptible Power Supply UPS Documentation","date":"January 22nd, 2006","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/01/uninterruptible-power-supply-ups-documentation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
