Thankfully, <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes\">this</a> page explains that it is available in the partner repository, and how to add it:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner\"\n</pre>\n<p>After I got that installed, I was still having problems, apparently because I'm using the Awesome window manager. The awesome <a href=\"http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java\">wiki</a> has a fix that worked for me, putting this at the top of /usr/bin/jedit:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nwmname LG3D\n</pre>\n<p>Alas, this causes problems with search and replace! I decided to switch back to the OpenJDK packages and switch to lxterminal.</p>\n<p>Funny, lxterminal started getting kind of sluggish for me, so I installed Xfce4-terminal and it rocks! So it's not so much a resolution but a workaround.</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n</pre>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/08/copy-and-paste-from-jedit-to-gnome-terminal-resolved/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Copy and Paste from jEdit to Gnome Terminal RESOLVED","date":"August 27th, 2010","tags":"java"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/08/copy-and-paste-from-jedit-to-gnome-terminal-resolved/"}},
