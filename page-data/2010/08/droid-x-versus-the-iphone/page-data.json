Thankfully its on the Verizon Wireless network, and it has some very useful apps.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I'm not sure why anyone would bother with an iPhone anymore!! The Droid X can even do one thing that any iPhone certainly cannot: be a 3G mobile hotspot. :-)</p>\n<p>Sorry Apple and AT&#x26;T Wireless, the Droid X is the phone for me.</p>\n<p>See Also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.neocarz.com/blog/2010/08/driving-with-the-android-powered-droid-x.html\">Driving with the Droid X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2010/08/droid-x-review.html\">Droid X Review and FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/08/droid-x-versus-the-iphone/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Droid X versus the iPhone","date":"August 16th, 2010","tags":"droid,iphone,\"verizon wireless\""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/08/droid-x-versus-the-iphone/"}},
