I helped her get it back by selecting \"View\" from the very top menu bar, then \"Layout\".</p>\n<p>Once there, all she had to do was activate the Contacts option.</p>\n<p>She thought she had accidentally deleted her address book. Thankfully, only the contacts pane, which displays the address book contents, was disabled.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/04/missing-the-address-book-in-outlook-express/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Missing the Address Book in Outlook Express","date":"April 24th, 2010","tags":"outlook"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/04/missing-the-address-book-in-outlook-express/"}},
