I decided I should make a list of my favorite tools these days just in case someone else hasn't happened to have tried one - it could make their day!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rake</strong> - an awesome, awesome make tool, heroic defender of system administrators' time and energy, helpful with testing and synthetic automation - in other words, its a good dog.</li>\n<li><strong>Gems</strong> - yes, this is a tool! And it comes with a bike shop, too. I use gems for conveniently organizing <em>and distributing</em> my common Ruby libraries. Since I predominantly write open source software, other people can use them too. More specifically, I use gemcutter and jeweler to package and distribute my gems.</li>\n<li><strong>Vlad</strong> - this is a simple \"continuous integration\" tool, and I like that it is simple and focused, leaving what's already been built to those existing libraries, like Rake</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll share more of my favorite tool choices as they come to mind.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/04/ruby-software-tools-for-all-my-projects/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby Software Tools For All My Projects","date":"April 24th, 2010","tags":"automation,gems,ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/04/ruby-software-tools-for-all-my-projects/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
