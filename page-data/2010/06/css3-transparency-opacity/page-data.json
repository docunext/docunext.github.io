This is also possible in browsers that support rgba (red, green, blue, alpha) color specifiers:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_css\">\n.transp5bg {\n  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.50);\n}\n</pre>\n<h4>Alpha Gradients - Yay!</h4>\n<p>Creating <em>gradients with transparency</em> are usually relegated to PNG graphics files, as they support 24-bit alpha channels. With CSS3, this is becoming possible. Its not all that difficult either!</p>\n<p>Here's a simple <strong>CSS3</strong> class which employs a <strong>gradient</strong> from gray to black, with support for recent versions of MSIE, Webkit (Safari, Chrome, etc.), and Mozilla (Firefox, Iceweasel, etc.):</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_css\">\n.g2b {\n  filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#555555', endColorstr='#000000');\n  background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(#555), to(#000));\n  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top,  #555,  #000);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>For transparency, I'm using <strong>rgba</strong>, which in my experience is not supported by MSIE 7 or 8.</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_css\">\n.transpgdbd {\n  background: transparent;\n  background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(rgba(0,0,0,0)), color-stop(0.5, #000), to(#000));\n  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, rgba(0,0,0,0), #000 400px);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>I've setup sketch99.com to with a CSS3 gradient so visitors can witness the action for themselves.</p>\n<h4>Multiple Transitions</h4>\n<h4>Browser Detection</h4>\n<p>Speaking of MSIE versus the-rest-of-the-world, this [page](http:// blog.niccai.com/post/51688182/maintainable-css-using-ie-specific-css-selectors) suggests and interesting way of creating an HTML body class specific to different versions of MSIE. I wouldn't use it, as its pretty bulky, and as the author admits, it doesn't validate.</p>\n<p>If I were to do something like this, I would use the conditional operators to set a javascript variable in the head, and then use javascript or jquery to add the class once the opening body tag gets loaded. Granted, I don't know if that would even work, but its where I would start.</p>\n<p>When it comes to browser detection, I'm OK with the comment based IE conditionals, but I don't like them. I don't enjoy supporting a company that doesn't support open source software! More to the point, I'm OK with them because even if a browser spoofs their user agent, only real MSIE browsers will process them.</p>\n<p>This is similar to how jQuery suggests testing for user agents - <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/\">check to see if it supports certain functionality</a> that needs to get used. If I want to check if a browser is IE, I will usually use:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_javascript\">\nif($.support.opacity) {\n  // not IE, or at least not a modern browser\n}\n</pre>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/06/css3-transparency-opacity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CSS3 Transparency Opacity","date":"June 15th, 2010","tags":"css,css3,opacity,transparency"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/06/css3-transparency-opacity/"}},
