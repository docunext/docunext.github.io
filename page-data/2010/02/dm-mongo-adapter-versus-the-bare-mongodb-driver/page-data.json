I really liked what I saw so far, and was only distracted by these new \"NoSQL\" document storage systems.</p>\n<p>In retrospect I find it a little ironic that I've circled around again to DataMapper!</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to dm-mongo-adapter. It seems heavier than I expected, and so I read up on the <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Tutorial\">MongoDB Ruby driver</a> and thankfully its super simple! Seems like the equivalent of a supercharged memcached client.</p>\n<p>I've just run through a <strong>very</strong> simple comparison and I like the bare driver better. Its super simple and the startup time for my Sinatra app is much faster. No doubt, the dm-mongo-adapter is cool, but it sort of brings me back to what I'm exploring away from (hence the irony I mentioned earlier). I still want to get my datamapper skills back in shape, but my experiments with mongodb are not the right time.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/02/dm-mongo-adapter-versus-the-bare-mongodb-driver/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"dm mongo adapter versus the Bare MongoDB Driver","date":"February 27th, 2010","tags":"datamapper,mongodb,ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/02/dm-mongo-adapter-versus-the-bare-mongodb-driver/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
