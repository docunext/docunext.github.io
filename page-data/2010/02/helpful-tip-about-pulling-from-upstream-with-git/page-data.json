Unfortunately for subversion, its showing me things I didn't even know about the ol' reliable svn...</p>\n<p>After trying this on <a href=\"http://github.com/docunext/docu-not-git-wiki\">docu-not-git-wiki</a> (a new branch to inspect minad's fork), I'm getting this error:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">fatal: You have not concluded your merge. (MERGE_HEAD exists)</pre>\n<p>I'm not sure how I fixed this, but I fiddled around with git reset HEAD git-wiki.rb and manually edited files, and then did:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">git commit -m \"ok\" -a</pre>\n<p>It seems to be fine, as I pushed the new branch and its now available on github.</p>\n<p>And lastly, to push tags to github:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">git push --tags</pre>\n<p>UPDATE: I'm not going to use that shortcut again anytime soon! It got me started with the idea, but obviously I don't understand the process well enough yet. My second attempt at creating a branch and merging upstream changes with it resulted in the entire history getting applied to both the branch and my mainline branch. Ugh! Thankfully docu-not-git-wiki is fairly simple. :-)</p>\n<p>Duh, yeah. I just looked at the alias again and it does indeed merge with master.
