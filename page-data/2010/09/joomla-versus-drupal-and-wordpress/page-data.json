I agree with their main point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing a software manually is not recommended (because you have to track\nsecurity updates yourself every day, then manually install/update the software\nquickly)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I'm not sure if I agree with the decision not to create a Joomla\npackage. Hopefully that is not a permanent decision, and I doubt it is, because\nfor a long time there wasn't a Wordpress package, but when it grew up, it got\npackaged!</p>\n<p>Joomla definitely seems popular enough to stay alive, and if enough people are\nusing it, Debian will most likely package it. As if there aren't a bunch of\noutdated, unused packages in the Debian repositories!</p>\n<p>But back to the review of Joomla and Drupal... its interesting that all these\nthree are coded in PHP.</p>\n<h4>Access Control Lists</h4>\n<p>After taking some serious time digging into Joomla 1.5, there is a glaring\nlimitation:</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Access Controls are Extremely Limited in Joomla 1.5</h4>\n<p>I witnessed this first hand when trying to limit read-access to an article in\nJoomla and had to rely on the <strong>special</strong> access group, which equates to users\ngiven author rights and above, as well as the <a\nhref=\"http://www.theartofjoomla.com/extensions/control.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">JX\nControl extension</a> to add another group.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the ACL architecture of Joomla has reportedly been totally revamped\nin 1.6!</p>\n<p>I haven't wrapped my brain around the ACL capabilities in Drupal, but I've heard\ngood things.</p>\n<h4>Wordpress Access Controls</h4>\n<p>Even these three software projects, I'm most familiar with Wordpress. However,\nthe last version of Wordpress I used was from a couple years ago, so I need to\ntry out the latest version. Nevertheless, based on my experience with Wordpress,\nit seems to me that Wordpress is much more focused on blogging than content\nmanagement, so access controls are likely not a major concern.</p>\n<p>Still, I have to try out the latest version to confirm that opinion.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/joomla-versus-drupal-and-wordpress/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Joomla versus Drupal and Wordpress","date":"September 29th, 2010","tags":"drupal,wordpress"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/09/joomla-versus-drupal-and-wordpress/"}}}
