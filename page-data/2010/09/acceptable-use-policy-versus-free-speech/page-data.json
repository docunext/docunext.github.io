While I personally feel the pastor's idea is a very bad one, I don't think he intended in to incite violence, though I would be surprised if it didn't.</p>\n<p>This raises the question about whether willful ignorance of crime or intent amount to the same thing. Looks like it is: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia states that courts usually state that defendants should know what their actions involve</a>.</p>\n<p>And as far as I know, inciting violence is not just against the acceptable use for Rackspace services, its also against the law!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/acceptable-use-policy-versus-free-speech/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Acceptable Use Policy versus Free Speech","date":"September 11th, 2010","tags":"rackspace"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/09/acceptable-use-policy-versus-free-speech/"}},
