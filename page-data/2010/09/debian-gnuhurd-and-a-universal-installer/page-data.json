It included work on a cross-platform <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Busybox</a> port and the \"de-Linux-ization\" of the Debian installer, which will definitely help other ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</li>\n<li>Debian GNU/kNetBSD</li>\n<li>Debian GNU/Minix</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What about the possibility of using a different set of userland tools besides the GNU tools? Perhaps we'll see a port like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debian BusyBox/Linux</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who knows??</p>\n<p>I also found the section about Config::Model very cool as well. I'm very interested to see how this project coordinates with etckeeper, Augeas, and Puppet.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debian GNU Hurd and a Universal Installer","date":"September 19th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/09/debian-gnuhurd-and-a-universal-installer/"}}}
