To me, its less cool than the Newton, and the only reason Apple has for producing it is the their Multi-touch technology and the App Store. Might be compelling for some, but not at all for me. I'd rather get a Nokia n900 for a handheld, a netbook for a tiny computer, and a Kindle for ebooks.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/01/enter-the-ipad/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Enter The iPad","date":"January 27th, 2010","tags":"app store,ipad,islate,multi-touch"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/01/enter-the-ipad/"}},
