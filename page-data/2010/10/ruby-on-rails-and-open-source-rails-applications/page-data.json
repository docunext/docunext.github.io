Consequently, I have embraced Sinatra - and I'm glad I did, because in my humble opinion, it rocks! From a practical perspective, Sinatra does not have the same reach as Rails, i.e. - droves of people have heard of Rails, and that can be an important factor.</p>\n<p>My experience with Rails is this: I've created a few test applications with Rails and support a production Rails application for one of my clients. That said, I need to brush up on my Rails.</p>\n<p><em>What should I do?</em> I'll look to the open source world for some open source Rails examples! Here are a few I've been familiar with for awhile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radiant: A CMS</li>\n<li>Redmine: An Issue Tracker</li>\n<li>Gitorious: A Web Interface for Git Repositories</li>\n<li>Ovirt: A virtual machine manager</li>\n<li>Mailr: A web interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These should help me learn and embrace Ruby on Rails! Still - I'll personally favor the mojo I have going on with Sinatra, jQuery, and XSL.</p>\n<h4>Radiant</h4>\n<p>Radiant is Rails-esque, meaning you can generate a new site skeleton, much like Rails can generate an app skeleton.</p>\n<p>Radiant also has cool extensions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrostatic - render pages to static files</li>\n<li>super_export - import/export of database to and from YAML files (would be nice to have JSON as well)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Redmine</h4>\n<p>This has a truly sweet interface, and is compatible with multiple version control repositories. I'm assuming its also compatible with the databases that Rails is generally compatible with: MySQL, SQLite, Postgres, etc.</p>\n<h4>Gitorious</h4>\n<p>Sorry, I'm a GitHub guy. I've tinkered around with Gitorious and was impressed, but felt it had some user interface issues.</p>\n<h4>Ovirt</h4>\n<p>Haven't used it yet, but its a virtual machine management interface.</p>\n<h4>Mailr</h4>\n<p>Looks cool, but why does it not support SQLite?? RoundCube does.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/10/ruby-on-rails-and-open-source-rails-applications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby on Rails and Open Source Rails Applications","date":"October 8th, 2010","tags":"git,jquery,postgres,ruby,\"ruby on rails\",sinatra,xsl"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/10/ruby-on-rails-and-open-source-rails-applications/"}}}
