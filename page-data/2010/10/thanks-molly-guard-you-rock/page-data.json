Big thank you to the developers who created it. :-)</p>\n<p>What is Molly Guard, you ask? It is a guard to protect big red switched from getting turned off, and it has a cool history, actually.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\n[University of Illinois] A shield to prevent tripping of some Big Red Switch by clumsy or ignorant hands. Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an IBM 4341 after a programmer's toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you'll see the much less interesting description \"guarded button\".\n</pre></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks: <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/molly-guard.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/molly-guard.html</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/10/thanks-molly-guard-you-rock/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thanks Molly Guard You Rock","date":"October 30th, 2010","tags":"systems administration"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/10/thanks-molly-guard-you-rock/"}},
