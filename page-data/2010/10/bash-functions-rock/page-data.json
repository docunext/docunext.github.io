To do so, I tried a bash script to modify a file my .bashrc file was sourcing. It worked, but I had to log out and log back in again.</p>\n<p>By using a function I added to .bashrc, the shell remained the same, and the PATH environment variable could be changed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/10/bash-functions-rock/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bash Functions Rock","date":"October 10th, 2010","tags":"ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/10/bash-functions-rock/"}},
