They are quite a pain in my opinion. I visit many websites only once, and thanks to Google Analytics, almost every website out there sets cookies.</p>\n<p>In addition to being annoying to clear out, they also cause proxy caches to not cache their content some of the time.</p>\n<p>So here's what I've done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/3_To_Block_HTTP_Headers\">Set Squid to \"anonymize\" http requests</a></li>\n<li>Set Google Chrome to block sites from storing any data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many web applications require cookies, so I use the \"Exceptions\" feature to allow them to store cookies.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many web applications also span across multiple sub-domains, and Google Chrome apparently doesn't support wildcard domain settings. More specifically, I have been unable to use this in my exceptions:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">.example.com</pre>\n<p>Usually that means any sub-domain of example.com. I also tried:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">*.example.com</pre>\n<p>Neither worked. :-(</p>\n<p>That means to access <a href=\"http://www.informedbanking.com/\">online banking services</a> from BankofAmerica.com or Chase.com, I've had to add about six domains for each one. Not a fun exercise.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, its possible to manually edit the Google Chrome preferences file on Debian. On my machine, its in ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Preferences, and the file looks like its in JSON format:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_javascript\">\n         \"www.docunext.com\": {\n            \"cookies\": 1\n         },\n</pre>\n<p>UPDATE: I've been browsing the net for a few days with this setup. The first day or so were annoying, but now things are going along smoothly and I'm occasionally finding more sites I still need cookies for. Thankfully Chrome notifies me when the cookie is required by the same domain as the one I'm currently viewing, and provides a shortcut button to edit my cookie preferences. I'm really glad I decided to make this step!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/03/cookie-management-in-chrome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cookie Management in Chrome and Squid","date":"March 5th, 2010","tags":"chrome,privacy"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/03/cookie-management-in-chrome/"}},
