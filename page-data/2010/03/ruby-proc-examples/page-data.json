They are also somewhat similar to function prototypes in that they can be bound to local variables, then called with new arguments.</p>\n<p>Abstract, yes. Useful, definitely!</p>\n<p>I don't use them everyday, but when I need them, they are often really useful. Especially when I am in the development process - I might not know exactly what I will need while I am writing code, and a proc is a really flexible placeholder to use as the logic evolves.</p>\n<p>Here's a basic Ruby proc example:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">\ndef blahblah(method)\n  return Proc.new { |string|\n    if method == 'reverse'\n      string.reverse\n    else\n      string.upcase\n    end\n  }\nend\nrme = blahblah('reverse')\nupme = blahblah('no')\nputs rme.call('howdy')\nputs upme.call('yo')\n</pre>\n<p>I need more practice with procs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2006/04/18/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-methods/\">Great article on Ruby Procs!</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/03/ruby-proc-examples/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby Proc Examples","date":"March 27th, 2010","tags":"ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/03/ruby-proc-examples/"}}}
