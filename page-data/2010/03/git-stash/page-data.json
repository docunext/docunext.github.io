In my understanding, its sort of like a temporary pre-commit. Meaning, its not a commit, but it temporarily saves the current tree state, then restores the tree to the last commit.</p>\n<p>I used it yesterday to quickly return to the last commit, tag it, and then restore my changes to commit them, like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit status\ngit stash save bigrefactor\ngit status\nls\ncat VERSION\ngit tag\ngit tag -a 0.1.3\ngit push origin master tags\ngit push origin master --tags\ngit stash list\ngit stash apply\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"major refactor, preparing for new version, fixed tests. still needs more testing\" -a\ngit push origin master\ngit diff\ngit commit -m \"removed unused variable\" -a\ngit diff\n</pre>\n<p>Nice!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/03/git-stash/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Git Stash","date":"March 22nd, 2010","tags":"commits,git"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/03/git-stash/"}}}
