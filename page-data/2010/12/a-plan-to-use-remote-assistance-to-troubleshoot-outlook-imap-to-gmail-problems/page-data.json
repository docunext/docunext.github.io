Shucks. Perhaps I should have simply tried GoToMyPC or something similar.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: I am using Remote Desktop at my new place of employment regularly and it works quite well, but I still prefer VNC.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/12/a-plan-to-use-remote-assistance-to-troubleshoot-outlook-imap-to-gmail-problems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Plan to Use Remote Assistance to Troubleshoot Outlook IMAP to GMail Problems","date":"December 4th, 2010","tags":"gmail,imap,outlook,performance"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/12/a-plan-to-use-remote-assistance-to-troubleshoot-outlook-imap-to-gmail-problems/"}},
