Wouldn't it be nice to have more flexible payments by proxy??? And yes, I realize that PayPal provides am inkling of this functionality, but no, it is of no use to me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, with Slicehost, they have options for \"Make a payment\" and \"Update my card on file\", which based upon my experience making online payments led me to believe that \"make a payment\" would allow me to enter in a different credit card for a one time payment. Alas, no, it was simple a manual method of charging the card on file.</p>\n<p>Now here comes the customer support dance:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\nHello,\n<p>Please do not try and charge my AMEX card for the $40 I entered. The \"make a payment\" option sounds like what is commonly a \"make a single payment\" option where one can enter in a different card than the one that is on file.</p>\n<p>I want to keep my AMEX card on file, but need to pay this month with another card.</p>\n<p>Please advise.</p>\n<p>Albert</p>\n</pre></blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/11/slicehost-payments/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slicehost Payments","date":"November 4th, 2010","tags":"slicehost"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/11/slicehost-payments/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
