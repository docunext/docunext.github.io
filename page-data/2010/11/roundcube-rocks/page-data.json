Its very slick in that it leverages modern javascript and CSS capabilities to serve as a <em>near desktop</em> email application.</p>\n<p>I prefer webmail to desktop mail, but I've traditionally used SquirrelMail. While I'd dabbled with RoundCube here and there in the past, I'm now using it regularly and so I can easily say:</p>\n<h4>\"RoundCube Rocks!\"</h4>\n<p>Like most IMAP email clients, it can manage folders with ease. However, unlike some webmail clients, it has the ability to connect with a relational database (SQLite, MySQL, etc) to store contacts and signature information. It can also connect with LDAP servers for this!!</p>\n<p>I'm eager to try out RoundCube plugins, particularly the managesieve plugins so that I can automatically organize my emails.</p>\n<p>Have you tried RoundCube? What do you think?</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/11/roundcube-rocks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"RoundCube Rocks","date":"November 6th, 2010","tags":"imap,ldap,mysql,php,roundcube,sieve,sqlite,squirrelmail,webmail"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/11/roundcube-rocks/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
