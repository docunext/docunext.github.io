Its hosted by Linode and this was the first notification I've received like it.</p>\n<p>I tried ssh'ing in without success, then tried a reboot, and shutdown but nothing was happening. I also tried using the Lish console, but that didn't work either. I created a ticket and got an immediate response saying they were experiencing network problems.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it appears the problems have been resolved fifteen minutes later.</p>\n<p>ACK! Looks like I spoke too soon. My VPS is again unavailable. Grrr.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: A little bit later they report the problem has been resolved and that it was a upstream routing issue.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/05/linode-network-issues/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linode Network Issues","date":"May 18th, 2010","tags":"linode,outages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/05/linode-network-issues/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
