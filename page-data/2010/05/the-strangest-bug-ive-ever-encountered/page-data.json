The bug is causing tidy_ffi to fail in its efforts to tidify a string when daemontools is running the Unicorn process, whereas it works fine if my user (or root) runs the process.</p>\n<p>At first I thought it was an environment variable missing, causing the string encoding to get messed up, but alas, no, that's not the problem.</p>\n<p>I checked and set most of the environment variables, including LANG, then debugged the process by putting the encoding name out. They were the same if I was running the process or if daemontools was running it.</p>\n<p>Anyone have <strong>any</strong> idea why this might happen?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I found a solution, but I still don't know why this was happening:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2010/06/strange-fix-for-the-strangest-bug/\">Strange Fix for the Strangest Bug</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2010/05/the-strangest-bug-ive-ever-encountered/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Strangest Bug I ve Ever Encountered","date":"May 26th, 2010","tags":"unicorn"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/05/the-strangest-bug-ive-ever-encountered/"}},
