I tripped over my power cable and while the resulting cable yank didn't cause the machine itself to break, it does have a difficult time staying connected to the power cable. I ofter have to jiggle the wire in the back, and its getting increasingly unstable.</p>\n<p>This is a common problem which Apple fixed with their mag-safe power adapter. I'm tempted to go the Apple route again (I've owned several Mac computers - desktops and laptops - though now I run Debian GNU/Linux), but I'm also considering getting an Ubuntu powered laptop. Decisions, decisions!</p>\n<p>I heard very cool things about Mac OS X Snow Leopard before it came out, but after it was released, very little. Maybe that's a good thing!</p>\n<p>Even the refurbished Macbook cost about $900, and that's for a 2Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo. There are Dell notebooks available with a 2.2Ghz Core 2 Duo with additional RAM for only $500. In these tight times, its tough to justify the additional expense. If it were OS X versus Windows, the choice would be clear: Mac OS X, but with Debian or Ubuntu available, its not so clear.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Hooray! Turns out it wasn't my computer's plug receptacle, but the power cable. Thankfully I have an extra one, so no new computer is needed right away.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/12/new-laptop-notebook-computer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Laptop Notebook Computer","date":"December 15th, 2009","tags":"linux,\"snow leopard\",ubuntu,windows"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/12/new-laptop-notebook-computer/"}},
