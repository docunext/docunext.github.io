For url \"tokens\" (references to resources, but not real files), I'll probably continue to use hyphens, though with the help of rewrite tools, I'm starting to use forward slashes, too.</p>\n<p>I'm still not comfortable with CamelCase, though. It's just OK for two words, but beyond that, I have a bit of an issue. I use Javascript, jQuery,, Perl, and Ruby a lot these days, and they definitely use capital letters in mid-string. Seems like JavaScript functions start with a lowercase letter, and only uppercase the second word, while Ruby classes start and split words with capital letters.</p>\n<p>Examples? BigDecimal (class) in Ruby and appendTo (function) in Ruby. And Perl seems to be a little different... subroutines seem to be all lowercase... no tower of babel here!!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hypens and Underscores","date":"December 19th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/12/hypens-and-underscores/"}}}
