Only glitch is that each request gets logged twice - could be a misconfiguration on my part. Yup - I commented out \"#use Rack::CommonLogger\" in my config.ru and now each request is only logged once.</p>\n<p>What is Unicorn? Its a Ruby-based webserver, is Rack compatible, and stays true to the UNIX philosophy.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/12/ruby-unicorn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby Unicorn","date":"December 16th, 2009","tags":"rack,ruby,unicorn"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/12/ruby-unicorn/"}},
