Previous app version is still running, try pushing again shortly\n !     We've been notified, see http://support.heroku.com if the problem persists\n !     Heroku push rejected, testfire failed\nerror: hooks/pre-receive exited with error code 2\n</pre>\n<p>I guess I shouldn't complain, seeing how I'm using the free version. But I have to wonder - does this sort of thing happen on the fee-based services?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Its back working again. I should note that the problem didn't cause my application to stop working, I just couldn't update it.</p>\n<p>Also, based on how awesome Heroku deployment is, I've investigated other <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/#Ruby_Deployment_Tools\">Ruby deployment tools</a>, and have decided to go with <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Vlad\">Vlad</a> for now.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/12/tried-out-heroku-again/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tried Out Heroku Again","date":"December 27th, 2009","tags":"heroku,ruby,\"web applications\""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/12/tried-out-heroku-again/"}},
