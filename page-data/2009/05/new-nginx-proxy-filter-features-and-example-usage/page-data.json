NGINX is really becoming an excellent filtering proxy with the help of the existing XSLT transformer. One thing I'm hoping to see soon is a Markdown filter. That would be sweet.</p>\n<p>It took me a moment to figure out how to use the proxy_cache, so here's and example. In the http configuration section:</p>\n<pre>\nhttp {    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;    default_type  application/octet-stream;    server_names_hash_bucket_size 128;    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;    large_client_header_buffers 4 16k;    proxy_buffer_size 16k;    proxy_buffers 8 16k;    proxy_busy_buffers_size 32k;    proxy_intercept_errors on;    proxy_cache_path  /var/lib/nginx/cache  levels=1:2   keys_zone=one:1m;    proxy_cache_valid  200 302  10m;}</pre>\n<p>The proxy<em>cache</em>path has to be on the same partition as the proxy<em>temp</em>path, and on debian, that is /var/lib/nginx/proxy.</p>\n<p>So that's just the base configuration. To have something get cached, I used the proxy_cache setting in a location directive:</p>\n<pre>    location /proxyme {        default_type image/jpeg;        image_filter_jpeg_quality 70;        image_filter   resize  100 100;        proxy_pass http://www.example.com/;        proxy_cache one;    }</pre>\n<p>That's also an example of how to use the image_filter module. I tried using variables for the resize parameters, but that didn't work. The resize feature keeps the scale of the original image, which is great.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New NGINX Proxy Filter Features and Example Usage","date":"May 31st, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/new-nginx-proxy-filter-features-and-example-usage/"}}}
