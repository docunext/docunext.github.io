I started the service reluctantly, but because I felt I could help some of my existing clients with problems they were experiencing with their previous hosts. I was able to improve their experience at a moderate premium, and all was good.</p>\n<p>I've never really advertised the service because the market is overcrowded and hyper-competitive. How could we compete with so many other options to choose from?</p>\n<p>Well, its been a few years and hosting has proven itself to be a viable business model when there is reasonably priced and high quality professional consulting services offered alongside pre-packaged hosting products.</p>\n<p>Therefore, after being on the fence for several years about it, I've decided to continue on with hosting, and to make it a core focus of my technology business practice. Its going to be fun!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/the-future-of-my-hosting-service-is-bright/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Future of My Hosting Service is BRIGHT","date":"May 19th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/the-future-of-my-hosting-service-is-bright/"}},
