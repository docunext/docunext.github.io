The Gyy is a low-power machine, made from biodegradable components, that also comes with the option to put solar panels on it.</p>\n<p>To me, putting solar panels on such a small device that is probably harder to use in sunlight is a little bit like the solar powered flashlight concept. But, I do appreciate the intent. You could also not use the device while its charging. I just think it would be easier to have a larger solar panel system setup to plug a variety of devices into. That wouldn't work if you were traveling though.</p>\n<p>The product is getting developed by <a href=\"http://www.iunika.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iunika</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/gyy-a-biodegradable-netbook/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gyy A Biodegradable Netbook","date":"May 23rd, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/gyy-a-biodegradable-netbook/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
