The documentation still leaves a little to be desired, but that's where the open source community comes in!</p>\n<p>There are some exciting new features in version two of this high performance proxy server:</p>\n<ul><li>ESI processing</li><li>Back-end health checking</li><li>Fail-over via \"restarts\"</li></ul>There are probably more I'm not mentioning here, but these ones are very important to me. I've only been using version 2.0 for about a week, but I'm already very impressed. The fail-over system is simple and straightforward - I lightly tested it and it worked perfectly for me.","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/varnish-20-reverse-proxy-cache-even-better/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Varnish 2.0 Reverse Proxy Cache Even Better","date":"May 27th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/varnish-20-reverse-proxy-cache-even-better/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
