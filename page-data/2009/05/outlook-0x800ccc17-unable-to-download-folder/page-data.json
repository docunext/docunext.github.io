Its reliable, fast, and well tested.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft's Outlook products have not gotten along well with IMAP in my experience, and many of my clients use Outlook.</p>\n<p>Recently an automatic upgrade to Outlook 2003 caused a user's credentials to stop working while at the same time giving an error: \"0x800CCC17 - Unable to Download Folder\". Then that same week another user's Outlook stopped displaying new mail. For no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>The first issue was fixed by reverting the Outlook update, and the second was fixed by recreating the user's Outlook account.</p>\n<p>Thankfully another user who was experiencing similar difficulty with Outlook and IMAP was willing to try Thunderbird. So far, so good. I'm confident he will be glad he switched.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/outlook-0x800ccc17-unable-to-download-folder/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Outlook 0x800CCC17 Unable to Download Folder","date":"May 6th, 2009","tags":"imap,outlook,thunderbird"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/outlook-0x800ccc17-unable-to-download-folder/"}},
