Like <a href=\"http://www.neocarz.com/blog/2009/04/30/chrysler-goes-bankrupt/\">Chrysler, they could come out of bankruptcy</a>, but my guess is that they won't be getting any bailout money. I didn't think that Chrysler should have gotten any either, by the way.</p>\n<p>Pystar was recently sued by Apple Computer for copyright infringement because Pystar was selling Mac-clone computers with OS X. So, I guess Apple wins, right?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/pystar-in-bankruptcy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pystar in Bankruptcy","date":"May 26th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/pystar-in-bankruptcy/"}}}
