Its a pretty amazing concept, and it does indeed work.</p>\n<p>I tried it out sometime last year, and I had hoped to gain a substantial speed boost in the process. I didn't get the speed boost I was looking for, so I put the project on the shelf.</p>\n<p>Today I was looking for ways to leverage the setuid capability of unix binaries. The obstacle of not being able to use setuid with shell scripts outweighed its convenience, so I was about to give up when I remembered the Roadsend PHP compiler.</p>\n<p>I'm going to try it out and see how it goes.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/05/roadsend-php-compiler/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roadsend PHP Compiler","date":"May 27th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/05/roadsend-php-compiler/"}},
