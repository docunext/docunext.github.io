In my experience it has displayed unpredictable IMAP support.</p>\n<p>I just read this in the Dovecot (an awesome IMAP server) configuration file about some workarounds:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\n  #   delay-newmail:\n  #     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP\n  #     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX\n  #     Mail (&lt;v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it\n  #     may show user \"Message no longer in server\" errors. Note that OE6 still\n  #     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to\n  #     \"Headers Only\".\n</pre>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/outlook-express-and-imap/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Outlook Express and IMAP","date":"August 25th, 2009","tags":"imap,outlook"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/outlook-express-and-imap/"}},
