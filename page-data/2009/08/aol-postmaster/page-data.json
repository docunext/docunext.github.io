Because I've always found AOL to be for the non-technical, I've had a non-technical perspective of the company at large, despite being a fan of <a href=\"http://www.opennsd.org/\">AOL Server and its TCL awesomeness</a>.</p>\n<p>I must say that I'm impressed with their postmaster support, and how they handle incoming e-mails. First off, there is a customer support request form for the error I was receiving:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_log\">\n(DYN:T1)  http://postmaster.info.aol.com/errors/421dynt1.html 421 SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE\n</pre>\n<p>I sent them this information:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\n\"We serve email and web hosting to about one dozen companies with separate domain names, as well as one bulk mailing list for one client. The bulk emails include a link and information to opt-out, and only customers who opt-in are added to the list.\n<p>We employ SPF records, and only allow authenticated users to send outgoing mail.\"\n</pre></blockquote></p>\n<p>After submitting that form, I found that they have a few other support options, including postmaster guidelines and a white list.</p>\n<p>Given how much of the internet is starting to depend upon the ip addresses for reputation and credibility, I sincerely hope that IPv6 gets its rear-in-gear!</p>\n<p>Note: I forgot that since my email gateway uses a sub-domain of my primary domain name, I had to setup my feedback loop (FBL) abuse address on that sub-domain. The reverse nameserver lookup resolves to that sub-domain, so I think my FBL will now be approved.</p>\n<p>Yes! I was approved! :-) I was denied on the pass listing request, because of the current block. I'll have to wait for the block to get removed before I can apply for pass listing again.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_Loop_%28email%29\">Feedback loop explanation at wikipedia</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/aol-postmaster/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AOL Postmaster and the Feedback Loop","date":"August 13th, 2009","tags":"smtp"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/aol-postmaster/"}},
