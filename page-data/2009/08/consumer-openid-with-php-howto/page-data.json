I used <a href=\"http://devzone.zend.com/article/3581\">the excellent \"getting started with OpenID and PHP\" guide from Zend</a> to integrate OpenID with <a href=\"http://www.phunkybb.com/\">PhunkyBB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">Nexista</a>.</p>\n<p>My implementation isn't totally done yet, but the OpenID integration is. I have to link openid strings with the phunkybb database, connecting the user_id field with the user openid.</p>\n<p>That shouldn't take long, and I'm very excited to get this launched and live. In addition to PhunkyBB, I've also added OpenID support on the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Docunext wiki</a> using a mediawiki plugin.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/consumer-openid-with-php-howto/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Consumer OpenID with PHP Howto","date":"August 16th, 2009","tags":"openid"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/consumer-openid-with-php-howto/"}}}
