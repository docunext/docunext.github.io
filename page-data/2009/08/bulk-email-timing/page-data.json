Its much easier to manage and monitor. To accomplish this, I used PHP / PEAR's Mail class, and issued a sleep command of two seconds between each single email getting sent out.</p>\n<p>I'm quite pleased to learn that PHP can run for thirty two hours and exit successfully. Cool!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/bulk-email-timing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bulk Email Timing","date":"August 2nd, 2009","tags":"php"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/bulk-email-timing/"}},
