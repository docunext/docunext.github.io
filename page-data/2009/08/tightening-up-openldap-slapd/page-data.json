After adding the above, other users were getting no results for their subtree searches. Access control in slapd.conf depends upon the order in which rules are listed. Additionally, it appears that rules can only be listed once. I've updated the access rules to only allow anonymous access to certain subtrees, read access to everything by a replicating user, and the rest remains the same. I'm specifying the user, but I may use this instead:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">access to attrs=entry,cn by anonymous read</pre>\n<p><b>\"SEARCH RESULT tag=101 err=32 nentries=0 text=\"</b>\nThat's the error I was getting at first.
