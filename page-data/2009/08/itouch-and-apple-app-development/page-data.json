In exchange, I let her borrow my extra <a href=\"http://www.digipixels.info/blog/\">digital camera</a>.</p>\n<p>The itouch is great. I'm hoping to try out some development using the multi-touch API Apple has provided for it.</p>\n<p>Its interesting that the app store is making money for its developers in a way that many developers have never seen before. I believe its due to the fact that the customers can bill the charge to their phone bill, instead of having to enter their credit card information. If Apple could make it as easy to do that with their laptops and desktop environments, the economic outlook for independent software developers would be much different.</p>\n<p>The purchasing convenience is very important, but so is the ease of install - another big win for iTouch and iPhone customers. Its very frustrating to have to migrate applications when you buy a new computer, only to realize that you've misplaced the registration code somewhere. If Apple (or some trusted app solution provider) were to securely store all this information, migrating from one device to another would be a breeze.</p>\n<p>Yes, this is where cloud computing is headed, but we're not there yet, not by a long shot. In the meantime, rock on, Apple! Keep foraging ahead!</p>\n<p>NOTE: I no longer use Apple as my personal operating system. As I became more focused on programming and networking, Apple became more focused on entertainment. I'm pleased to learn that Snow Leopard is getting back to the basics. Maybe I'll get back to the Mac? Still, I'd miss ext3, LVM, and awesome. Shocking about ext3, I know, but it works. I'd love to see Apple switch to using ZFS instead of HFS+ altogether, but I doubt that will happen anytime soon.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/itouch-and-apple-app-development/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iTouch and Apple App Development","date":"August 28th, 2009","tags":"Apple,\"app store\",apps,iphone,multi-touch,\"snow leopard\""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/itouch-and-apple-app-development/"}},
