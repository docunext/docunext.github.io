The first version didn't work for me at all, but the second version is screaming fast. There are a few minor glitches I've found, but its quickly becoming my browser of choice.<div></p>\n</div><div>My favorite thing about it so far is that its fast, but the fact that it keeps my laptop running cooler by being more efficient is really awesome too.
