I first make sure that the proxies are setting up the X-Forwarded-For header correctly, even if there are multiple proxies. Then I started using mod_extract_forwarded on the origination of content server, which in my case is an Apache 2.2 server, otherwise I wouldn't be able to use the extract forwarded module!</p>\n<p>Its not a debian package (yet), but it was easy enough for me to configure.
