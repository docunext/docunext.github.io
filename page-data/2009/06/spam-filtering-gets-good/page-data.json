Its taken a long time to get working but it was totally worth it.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness for quality software like Postfix, gray listing daemon, spamassassin, and for the resources provided by upstanding netizens like spamhaus and dnswl.</p>\n<p>The first line of defense is Postfix and the dns block lists and the gray listing daemon. After those two hurdles, a few stray spams get through, and that's where spamassassin comes into play. There are some really great features available with Postfix spam controls - such as the address classes. For example, one of my clients regularly gets email from Asia, while I hardly ever do. With recipient address classes, I'm able to filter incoming mail differently, depending on its final destination. How cool is that?!?!? I previously disabled the <a href=\"http://www.okean.com/antispam/sinokorea.html\">Okean</a> lists to make sure my client's mail isn't interrupted, but I may resume use for my own emails - possibly for rejecting, but maybe just for appending a header to possibly make spamassassin's life a little easier.</p>\n<p>Spamassassin has been tough for me to figure out, I think because its so flexible. I don't expect it to be perfect, but it is able to catch obvious spams via content which I don't want to bother postfix with. Besides, spamassassin can work with maildrop to quarantine the spam, not reject it.</p>\n<p>To avoid false positives - the situation where a non-spam email gets flagged as spam, I use the dns pass list I mentioned earlier, and I also create my own pass lists for regular email addresses and clients. This was a good thing for me to do - its keeps email delivery fast and efficient for ham messages, and it also avoids the overhead of scanning legitimate emails with spamassassin.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/06/spam-filtering-gets-good/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spam Filtering Gets Good","date":"June 23rd, 2009","tags":"maildrop,postfix,spam,spamassassin,spamhaus"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/06/spam-filtering-gets-good/"}},
