I usually don't bother trying to support MSIE as I'd rather give users another reason to switch to Firefox or something powered by Webkit.</p>\n<p>In this case it had to be done - it was for one of my clients and they do get some MSIE visitors. There is a slight delay when the images load, but at least they look good!</p>\n<p>I'm using a 50% alpha channel on some backgrounds, and a 100% transparent background on another. The first issue I had was with the div background - I guess the CSS is pretty picky about it. This seems to work OK:</p>\n <pre>#mydivid {\nbackground:#000 url(/s/img/bkimg.jpg) no-repeat scroll left bottom;\nwidth: 500px;\nheight: 375px;\nbackground-color:transparent;\ntext-align: left;\n}\n</pre>Once I got that working, I tried to use a conditional for the CSS to include the iepngfix.htc, but that wasn't happening, so I just inserted it into the main stylesheet.","fields":{"slug":"/2009/06/internet-explorer-pngs-4-eva/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Internet Explorer PNGs 4 EVA","date":"June 12th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/06/internet-explorer-pngs-4-eva/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
