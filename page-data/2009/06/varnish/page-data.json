It is a caching reverse proxy designed for high-traffic sites to alleviate loads on back-end servers. It supports a wide range or request rewriting and modification. It also includes load balancing and fail-over mechanisms as well as grace periods where stale content can be served in lieu of a back-end connection failure. Here's why I'm featuring it on our Software Rebirth blog:</p>\n<p>First of all, it is open source. Need we say more?</p>\n<p>Second of all, it is designed for modern systems. It runs well on modern operating systems like linux 2.6 / GNU and FreeBSD 7. It leverages characteristics of the kernels to keep itself simple in design.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the architecture and design is well thought out and documented, so that those who question the design decisions can refer to its plan.</p>\n<p>I'm a huge fan of Varnish because I use it on my servers and it has served me well, no pun intended.</p>\n<p>More information about Varnish:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Docunext Wiki Page on Varnish</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.proxy-sys.com/blog/varnish/\">Proxy Systems Varnish Category</a></li><li><a href=\"http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/\">Varnish Wiki at Linpro</a>\n</li></ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Varnish Proxy Cache","date":"June 8th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/06/varnish/"}}}
