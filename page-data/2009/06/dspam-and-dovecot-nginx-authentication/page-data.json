Well today I finally installed it. I still have to actually use it, but I'm taking one step at a time. I'm a little annoyed that it appears that I have to use clamav with it, but whatever. More detailed notes about my experience with DSpam can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">DSpam page at Docunext</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dovecot Authentication</strong></h4>\n<p>I've also wanted to try Dovecot for a long time. I've heard really good things about it, but I just haven't had enough problems with Courier-IMAP to make the full switch.</p>\n<p>Recently when exploring redundant eSMTP servers, I realized that Postfix requires SASL authentication, and went looking for a lightweight, dynamic back-end for saslauthd. Saslauthd can use a variety of back-ends, such as LDAP and IMAP authentication. I chose IMAP authentication, and then selected Dovecot as the IMAP server because it has a very flexible authentication system.</p>\n<p>As I'm writing this, I'm coming to realize that NGINX is actually a more appropriate solution. Its authentication system is extremely simple and therefore flexible. I'll have to try it out!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/06/dspam-and-dovecot-nginx-authentication/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DSpam and Dovecot NGINX Authentication","date":"June 24th, 2009","tags":"dovecot,imap,ldap,nginx,sasl,smtp"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/06/dspam-and-dovecot-nginx-authentication/"}}}
