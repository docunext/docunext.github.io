I'd heard mention of it getting tested with FreeNAS, an embedded FreeBSD network-attached-storage appliance, so I visited their website.</p>\n<p>While I was glad to see that ZFS is now available in FreeNAS, I was even more pleased to read about the wake-on-lan patches contributed by Tobias Reber. The lack of wol functionality in FreeBSD bugged me, and its awesome that its now becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>Kudos FreeBSD!!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/freebsd-wake-on-lan/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FreeBSD Wake on LAN","date":"July 5th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/freebsd-wake-on-lan/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
