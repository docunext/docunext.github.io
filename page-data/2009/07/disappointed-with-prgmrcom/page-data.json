I had high expectations for them. Doh!</p>\n<p>I'm going to give Fsck VPS a try. They have great prices on bandwidth.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Prgmr.com has resolved my issue by setting up my account. I've just logged in and everything appears to be in working order. In the few moments I've had to start using it, I can tell I'm going to like this service. Their network has really low latency and Xen is setup really well, I think their setup even includes the ability install custom kernels! :-)</p>\n<p>After I get this vps up and doing what I need it to, I may consider ordering another one from prgmr.com.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/disappointed-with-prgmrcom/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My experience with prgmr.com","date":"July 24th, 2009","tags":"vpn,xen"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/disappointed-with-prgmrcom/"}},
