It makes it difficult to resolve the situation, and it doesn't have to be that way.</p>\n<p>Years ago I found humor in the Dreamhost support request form that gave options such as \"I'm a newbie\", \"I know what I'm talking about\", and \"I don't mean to brag, but I probably know more about this than you do\". Beyond the humor - its very helpful information!</p>\n<p>I like Prgmr.com's statement, but their actions are even more of a plus. In my experience, they've assumed that I'm smart, and I appreciate that. I am good at troubleshooting - like today, why wouldn't my recently installed varnish package start? I tried running it manually and received the following error:</p>\n <pre class=\"bash\">myprgmracct:~# varnishd \"-a :80 \\\n             -T localhost:6082 \\\n             -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl \\\n             -s file,/var/lib/varnish/myprgmracct.xen.prgmr.com/varnish_storage.bin,1G\"\ngetaddrinfo(): Name or service not known\n</pre>Aha! I remembered seeing no localhost entry in /etc/hosts. No problem - I added it: \"127.0.0.1 localhost\" and it started without issue.\n<p>It would probably be a good idea to include this entry as a default as many distros do. Just a suggestion.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/good-business-practice-assume-your-customer-is-smart/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Good Business Practice Assume Your Customer is Smart","date":"July 29th, 2009","tags":"hosting,troubleshooting,vps"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/good-business-practice-assume-your-customer-is-smart/"}},
