I'd previously thought that Mutt could only access a local Maildir, but now I'm using it to access a remote IMAP server. I'm actually quite amazed with how many protocols and even authentication methods Mutt supports.</p>\n<p>When I first set it up, I had some problems with outgoing emails. Mutt was using my local hostname. I then figured out how to arrange a few headers:</p>\n<pre>\nset realname=\"Joe User\"\nset from=\"user@host\"\nset use_from=yes\n</pre>\n<p>I may end up reverting back to using a local maildir, and OfflineIMAP to synchronize the folders.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/mutt-email-reader/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mutt Email Reader","date":"July 8th, 2009","tags":"offlineimap"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/mutt-email-reader/"}}}
