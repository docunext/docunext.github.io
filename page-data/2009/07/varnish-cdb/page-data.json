Would it be fast enough for every request? I think it would be, cdb is the fastest hash reference that I'm aware of. It would be nice for keeping urls consistent over time, without having to rely on complex regular expressions for everything. Regular expressions are great for some url rewriting schemes, but sometimes all you need is a simple key-value pair.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/varnish-cdb/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Varnish CDB","date":"July 29th, 2009","tags":"proxies"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/varnish-cdb/"}},
