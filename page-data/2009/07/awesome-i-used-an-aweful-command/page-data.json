In my configuration file, I've also set my sticky apps to be floating, and for floating apps to have titlebars. Xterm, however, starts up against the top of the screen, hiding the menubar, so it can't be repositioned.</p>\n<p>To cut to the chase, here's the command I'm using:</p>\n <pre>awful.placement.centered(c)</pre>\n<p>Not very exciting, huh? Actually I'm quite pleased!</p>\n<p>In my book, a sticky window isn't sticky unless its always on top. Thankfully the default titlebar I mentioned earlier includes a star icon which makes the window always on top. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/awesome-i-used-an-aweful-command/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Awesome I used an Aweful Command","date":"July 14th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/awesome-i-used-an-aweful-command/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
