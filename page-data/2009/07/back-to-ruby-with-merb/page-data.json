I'm not a fan of Python's white space handling, but I do like how capable and logical it is.</p>\n<p>With Perl, there are so many things to love: the flexibility, built-in regular expressions, the libraries, CPAN, and the general community is really amazing.</p>\n<p>But let's talk about Ruby some more. I was first disinterested by the amount of hype surrounding Ruby-on-Rails, but I liked some of the descriptions of Ruby. Eventually I gave Ruby-on-Rails a go, but I didn't like how the ORM took care of <b>everything</b>. I actually <i>enjoy</i> getting into the SQL and rummaging around a little!</p>\n<p>Another thing which annoyed me about RoR was the javascript library. I'm a jQuery guy, and that's what I'm sticking with.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me, Hpricot caught my attention because I read that it's selectors were similar to jQuery's.</p>\n<p>Now I think I've found my toolkit: nokogiri and merb. If only I could setup an XSLT merb view - something like mexcess.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/back-to-ruby-with-merb/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to Ruby with Merb","date":"July 29th, 2009","tags":"ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/back-to-ruby-with-merb/"}},
