I just wasn't using it because the latency was not very low and even though the machine supposedly had access to 512MB of memory it wasn't enough to run Varnish. Also, I felt it wasn't worth the extra expense when compared to the other, lower priced VPS companies I've been working with lately.</p>\n<p>I'm planning on setting up another Linode VPS soon, though I'm still getting good results from RapidXen, VPS Ville, and Slicehost.</p>\n<p>However, I mayÂ  end up going with <a href=\"http://prgmr.com/\">prgmr.com</a>. I've wanted to try them out for awhile, though I've been hesitant simply because they only accept PayPal. Ah wait - looks like they accept checks now! Good, I'll try one month via PayPal if I can use a credit card and then will pay by check in an effort to simplify my <a href=\"http://www.pbooks.org/\">bookkeeping</a> tasks.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/cancelled-vps-link-account-again/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cancelled VPS Link Account Again","date":"July 16th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/cancelled-vps-link-account-again/"}}}
