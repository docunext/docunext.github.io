When booting, it freezes when it starts to load the manual modules. Duh, I think I just figured it out. I'm checking my /etc/modules file now:</p>\n<pre>acpi\ncpufreq_conservative\nfuse\nlp\nvia-rng\npadlock-aes\npadlock-sha\ncryptosoft\nocf\ncryptodev\n</pre>\n<p>I must have custom compiled the 2.6.24 kernel I'm using now to include the cryptosoft / ocf modules. Still, the system shouldn't freeze like it is. Right - I just checked and the 2.6.24 kernel that works isn't custom. It still boots without being able to load those extra modules. I'll shelve this issue for now.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/ubuntu-and-2628-versus-everex-stepnote/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu and 2.6.28 versus Everex StepNote","date":"July 16th, 2009","tags":"ubuntu"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/ubuntu-and-2628-versus-everex-stepnote/"}},
