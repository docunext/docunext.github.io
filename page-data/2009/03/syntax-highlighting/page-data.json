I also did it for <a href=\"http://shjs.sourceforge.net/doc/documentation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">shjs</a>, which uses class too. Ultimately I think that syntax highlighting should be a client side process, especially for code snibbets which are embedded in other markup. Complete files are much easier to send through a web server filter (like source-highlighter) for faster processing and cacheable content. Wordpress does some wacky internal formatting and filtering like changing quotes and such, and thankfully wp-syntax avoids all that, so I'm sticking with it for as long as I use Wordpress for rendering output.</p>\n<p>I would also like to use &#x3C;code> tags along with &#x3C;pre>, but that makes some of my transformations with XSL a little more difficult to use them together. I may end up switching to only using &#x3C;code> - in that case I'll have a lot of tags to change over!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/03/syntax-highlighting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Source Code Syntax Highlighting For Fun and Profit","date":"March 5th, 2009","tags":"javascript,\"source code\",syntax"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/03/syntax-highlighting/"}},
