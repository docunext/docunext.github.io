It uses the WebKit HTML engine, and a new javascript engine called V8.</p>\n<p>I love trying out new stuff, so I managed to hack it into my debian laptop, but (I guess due to ia32 / gtk differences) the browser won't display any pages, everything just shows up blank.</p>\n<p>I then started to try and install on a 32-bit ubuntu machine, but of course I also decided to upgrade it to Jaunty Jackalope. Jaunty is still in alpha, so I wasn't surprised to find its wasn't a totally smooth upgrade. I'm still working on it... well the upgrade is done and everything looks good. Unfortunately, I'm still getting blank screens with Chromium. :-(</p>\n<p>Turns out I just needed to install the Microsoft fonts installer package. After that, it started to display pages. Let's see if that works for on my Debian 64-bit machine:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\napt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer</pre>\n<p>Nope, I guess I already had that installed.</p>\n<p>I noticed on the opening screen that blogging is discouraged. That's too bad, I disagree with the statement that it doesn't help.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Chromium on Ubuntu","date":"March 23rd, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/03/chromium-on-ubuntu/"}}}
