I mean, why bother open sourcing it if so many people won't bother using it because it will never make it into the mainline kernel?</p>\n<p>Its already gotten a warm welcome from Mac OS X and FreeBSD, and I'd guess that more people would be willing to venture further into OpenSolaris if they had positive experiences with ZFS.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, btrfs is coming along, and will probably be done by the time the Sun executives figure out that they should release ZFS under the GPL. Oh well.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/03/zfs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ZFS","date":"March 4th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/03/zfs/"}}}
