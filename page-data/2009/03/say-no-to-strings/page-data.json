I had a tough time dropping disable-output-escaping, as I first tried xsl:copy-of, which resulted in an empty xmlns attribute in xhtml docs.</p>\n<p>I finally remembered that the nodes just have to be rebuilt, either using xsl:element or the new elements entirely. Now to try and keep things flexible, I'll need to craft up some xsl:templates for common html elements. So far I've got script and link, but of course I'll need a whole bunch more than that.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/08/02/xslt/index.html\">attribute sets</a>!</p>\n<p>Hah, well its actually not that difficult. All that was needed was an identity transform which avoids copy and copy-of. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.edginet.org/\">Ben</a>, its really quite simple!</p>\n<pre class=\"xml\"><xsl:template match=\"node()\"><xsl:element name=\"{name()}\"><xsl:apply-templates select=\"@*|node()\"/></xsl:element></xsl:template><xsl:template match=\"@*|text()|comment()|processing-instruction()\"><xsl:copy/></xsl:template></pre>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/03/say-no-to-strings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Say No to Strings","date":"March 22nd, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/03/say-no-to-strings/"}},
