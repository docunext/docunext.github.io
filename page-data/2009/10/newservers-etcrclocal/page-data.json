I just tested it by adding:</p>\n<pre>\ntouch /tmp/doesthiswork\n</pre>\n<p>to the end of it and rebooted. After rebooting, the contents of /etc/rc.local remained the same and doesthiswork appeared in /tmp/.</p>\n<p>Maybe if something gets messed up and it can't contact any networks, there are some overrides. I had previously used it to remove a bunch of unwanted modules which weren't getting blocked by /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.</p>\n<h2><strong>Hostname</strong></h2>\n<p>Currently the hostnames of the machines I've used from NewServers is something like: <em>server1866.newservers.com</em>.</p>\n<p>What if I wanted to setup a mailserver and needed a reverse IP DNS (PTR) entry? I'd want that entry to match my machine's hostname.</p>\n<p>To prep, I setup the /etc/hostname file, and then added the corresponding line into /etc/hosts. Let's see if it persists through a reboot. It should, but I want to make sure.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Its nice that changes to the NewServers firewall setup persist through reboots. The iptables state is saved to /etc/sysconfig/iptables. I wonder, is that a NewServers directory or a CentOS directory? Looks like its a CentOS or wider directory, but I don't think its used on Debian. Nope, just checked.</p>\n<p>My hostname setting did not persist across a reboot. Hmmm. What's up with that?</p>\n<p>For some reason, while using the NewServers.com machine, I feel constrained by the stuff that's already there. I am impressed with their technical knowhow, but I'm skeptical of anything that hasn't been thoroughly reviewed by peers - hence the reason why I love open source software!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/newservers-etcrclocal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NewServers etc rc.local and what about the Hostname","date":"October 21st, 2009","tags":"dedicated servers,modules,newservers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/newservers-etcrclocal/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
