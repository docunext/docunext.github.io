I've used <a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2007/11/avoiding-agoga.html\">m0n0wall to block mistyped URLs from ending up at Agoga</a>.</p>\n<p>I also explained how I might achieve something similar like blocking all access to a domain that has multiple sub-domains and is multi-homed across several IP subnets:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe reject rule is only faster with regard to the browser's response,\nnot the setup. The browser's \"thinking icon\" will keep spinning if its\nrequest packets are silently dropped. If they are rejected, the\nbrowser should immediately respond back to the user saying the page\ncannot be displayed.\n<p>If I were trying to do what you describe, I would use the DNS\nForwarder -> Domain Override to point DNS queries to  *.example.com to\na private authoritative DNS server which responds with a single IP\naddress to which access through the firewall from the LAN is denied.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/the-importance-of-dns-and-how-to-leverage-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Importance of DNS and How to Leverage It","date":"October 9th, 2009","tags":"access control,m0n0wall"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/the-importance-of-dns-and-how-to-leverage-it/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
