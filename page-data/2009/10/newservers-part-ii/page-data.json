Its running processes like this: dsm<em>sa</em>datamgr3.</p>\n<p>There is a license which I am not interested in agreeing with, and I wonder how this would affect my relationship with NewServers.</p>\n<p>The dellomsa package appears to be removable though:</p>\n<pre>\n$ dpkg -l | grep dell\nii  dellomsa                                   5.5.0-5                     Dell OpenManage Server Administrator 5.\n</pre>\n<p>I'll hold off on doing so for the moment. I read their terms of service and acceptable use policy and neither say anything about the Dell OpenManage Server Admin. I did note, however, that the terms of service states that all payments are non-refundable, but the documentation pages state this:</p>\n<p>\"Your credit card will be charged $20 to make an initial deposit to your NewServers account. Any unused portion can be withdrawn at anytime by making a request to billing@newservers.com\"</p>\n<p>Which is it? Only the initial $20 can be withdrawn? The billing page also says this:</p>\n<p>\"You may withdraw your account balance at any time.\"</p>\n<p>Given how much thought has been put into their service, I'm confident they'll clarify their communications very soon.</p>\n<h2><strong>Hardware</strong></h2>\n<p>I'm taking a closer look at the hardware their service uses. First thing that catches my attention is the apparent lack of a hardware based random number generator (HWRNG) on the Dell 1855. Why, Dell? Why?</p>\n<p>I did some research and it appears to be true: the M600 as well as the 1855 blades lack hardware based random number generators. Doh!</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">lack of a HWRNG might cause problems for folks running linux with SSL</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Customizing the Setup</strong></h2>\n<p>I'm upgrading to Intrepid Ibex (9.04) from Hardy Heron (8.04). I was hoping to use do-release-upgrade, but it appears I'll have to modify /etc/apt/source.list. Actually, no I don't have to. I can change /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades to normal.</p>\n<p>I ended up upgrading all the way to 9.10. I created a disk image, this time using the manual reboot. I cancelled my server, created a new one, and am now restoring my disk image. Hopefully I'll be able to login and find things just as I left them!</p>\n<p>Uh-oh. I think the same thing that happened before is happening again. When I restore the image it remains totally unavailable. I guess this might be the reason why they aren't advertising ubuntu as a default image option?</p>\n<h2><strong>Hourly Increments</strong></h2>\n<p>I just realized that when I start and cancel a server twice within one hour, I get charged for two hours. I would like for that to have been clearer, as I was only testing out the imaging functionality. In the future I'll just leave the existing server running and start a new one.</p>\n<h2><strong>My Overall Consensus</strong></h2>\n<p>This is going to be a great service, the key words being \"going to be\". Without a doubt, they need to have an out-of-band console. Apparently the more expensive servers have KVMoverIP, but even the cheap ones should have ajaxterm or something similar. Without that its impossible to know why the newservers website says a freshly installed image is \"active\", but the ip cannot be reached via ssh and is non-responsive to pings.</p>\n<p>Also it seems very odd to me that when you are creating a new server, you can't select an image you've already saved...</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h2>\n<p>To save memory:</p>\n<pre>\n# Custom\nblacklist lp\nblacklist parport_pc\nblacklist parport\nblacklist hidp\nblacklist rfcomm\nblacklist bluetooth\nblacklist l2cap\nblacklist ipv6\nblacklist ip6_tables\nblacklist backlight\nblacklist video\nblacklist button\nblacklist battery\nblacklist pcspkr\nblacklist ac\nblacklist dm_raid45\nblacklist dm_mirror\nblacklist dm_multipath\nblacklist acpi_memhotplug\nblacklist dm_region_hash\nblacklist dm_region_hash\nblacklist dm_mem_cache\nblacklist dm_log\nblacklist dm_mod\nblacklist uhci_hcd\nblacklist ohci_hcd\nblacklist ehci_hcd\nblacklist sbs\nblacklist i2c_ec\nblacklist i2c_core\n\nchkconfig gpm off\nchkconfig pcscd off\nchkconfig acpid off\n</pre>\n<p>Blacklist not working for me:</p>\n<pre>\nrmmod lp\nrmmod parport_pc\nrmmod parport\nrmmod hidp\nrmmod rfcomm\nrmmod bluetooth\nrmmod l2cap\nrmmod ipv6\nrmmod ip6_tables\nrmmod backlight\nrmmod video\nrmmod button\nrmmod battery\nrmmod pcspkr\nrmmod ac\nrmmod dm_raid45\nrmmod dm_mirror\nrmmod dm_multipath\nrmmod acpi_memhotplug\nrmmod dm_region_hash\nrmmod dm_region_hash\nrmmod dm_mem_cache\nrmmod dm_log\nrmmod dm_mod\nrmmod uhci_hcd\nrmmod ohci_hcd\nrmmod ehci_hcd\nrmmod sbs\nrmmod i2c_ec\nrmmod i2c_core\n</pre>\n<p>The amount of time it takes to restore a server?</p>\n<p>Server1272 started at 10-16-2009 23:17:08, at Sat Oct 17 00:25:31 EDT 2009 the server status is still: Restoring Harddrive Image.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/newservers-part-ii/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NewServers Part II","date":"October 15th, 2009","tags":"newservers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/newservers-part-ii/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
