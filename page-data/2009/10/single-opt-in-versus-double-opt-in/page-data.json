Its like RAID0 which stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, but there is no redundancy.</p>\n<p>Single opt-in means that someone submits an email to be included in a mailing\nlist, as opposed to someone gathering emails to put together a mailing list. The problem with the single opt-in is that the person submitting the email isn't necessarily the owner of the email!</p>\n<p>Nowadays most network managers require a double opt-in process, whereby someone submits an email to a mailing list, and then the mailing list sends out a confirmation email to the owner, asking them to verify that they were the one who requested inclusion to the list.</p>\n<p>Seems obvious to me that every mailing list should implement double opt-in procedures.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/single-opt-in-versus-double-opt-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Single Opt In versus Double Opt In","date":"October 16th, 2009","tags":"mailing lists"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/single-opt-in-versus-double-opt-in/"}},
