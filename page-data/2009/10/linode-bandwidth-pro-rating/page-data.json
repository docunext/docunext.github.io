I sent them this trouble ticket:</p>\n<blockquote>\nHello,\n<p>Just wanted to give you a heads up that I have a problem with the way you pro-rate bandwidth extras.</p>\n<p>If I pay for a partial month, and cancel midway through, I get a refund for the remaining part of the month. That makes sense.</p>\n<p>However, since I've still paid for the previous part of the month, that should be included in the calculation the remaining bandwidth allowance, but it is not.</p>\n<p>Its not a big deal, but since I'm a bit of a math nerd from time to time I figured I would mention this.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, love the service!</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/linode-bandwidth-pro-rating/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linode Bandwidth Pro Rating","date":"October 13th, 2009","tags":"bandwidth,linode,vps,xen"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/linode-bandwidth-pro-rating/"}},
