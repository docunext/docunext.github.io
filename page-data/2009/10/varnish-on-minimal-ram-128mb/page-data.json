It makes HTTP redundancy a lot easier, even for small networks like mine.</p>\n<p>I've previously felt that 256MB or more RAM was necessary, but I'm experimenting with a setup now that seems to work.</p>\n<p>Here's my setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CentOS 5 minimal - uses only about 8MB of RAM out of the box</li>\n<li>NGINX on port 80 - uses very little RAM; 2MB?</li>\n<li>Varnish on localhost:6081 - uses a lot, but can be limited</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the /etc/sysconfig/varnish file I'm using:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nDAEMON_OPTS=\"-a localhost:6081 \\\n             -T localhost:6082 \\\n             -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl \\\n             -w 1,4,10 \\\n             -p sess_timeout=2 \\\n             -p thread_pools=3 \\\n             -p first_byte_timeout=300 \\\n             -u varnish -g varnish \\\n             -s file,/var/lib/varnish/varnish_storage.bin,1G\"\n</pre>\n<p>I'm running this on an OpenVZ container. Seems to work OK.</p>\n<p>Memory usage:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\n# free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:           128        116         11          0          0          0\n-/+ buffers/cache:        116         11\nSwap:            0          0          0\n</pre>\n<p>UPDATE: Today, about two days after I originally wrote this post, I tried to ssh into this machine and was greeted with an ssh error. I think it was starving for memory. I was able to reboot it, but I guess its just not happening.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/varnish-on-minimal-ram-128mb/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Varnish on Minimal RAM 128MB","date":"October 25th, 2009","tags":"caching,http,memory,ram,varnish"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/varnish-on-minimal-ram-128mb/"}},
