It would also need to depend upon <a href=\"http://www.proxy-sys.com/\">proxy cache and redirection servers</a> to be any different than a routing system. Know what I'm talking about? Varnish!</p>\n<p>When I use the word federated, I mean distributed in a sane and synchronized manner. This type of network service / setup is becoming more popular, than say a strictly redundant configuration.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/virtual-private-server-and-network-peering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Virtual Private Server and Network Peering","date":"October 11th, 2009","tags":"routing,virtualization,vpn,vps"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/virtual-private-server-and-network-peering/"}},
