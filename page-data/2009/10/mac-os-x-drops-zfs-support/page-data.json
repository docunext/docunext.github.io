I was pleased to learn about ZFS and some of its unique capabilities when it was released under an open source license. Based on my interest, I tried out Nexenta and that seemed pretty cool.</p>\n<p>When I heard it was ported to FreeBSD and Mac OS X, I was even more pleased.</p>\n<p>Who knows why Apple has dropped their interest in ZFS. It might have nothing to do with the file system itself.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/10/mac-os-x-drops-zfs-support/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac OS X Drops ZFS Support","date":"October 29th, 2009","tags":"freebsd,mac,zfs"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/10/mac-os-x-drops-zfs-support/"}},
