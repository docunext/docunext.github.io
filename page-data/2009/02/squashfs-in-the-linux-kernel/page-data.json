Awesome.</p>\n<p>Morton's tree includes unionfs, but I'm still confused about whether to use aufs or unionfs.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I did finally figure out how to get aufs to work, not a big deal at all.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Squashfs 3.4 patches (seemingly) OK against 2.6.28.4 using the linux-2.6.27-rc4-next kernel patch.
