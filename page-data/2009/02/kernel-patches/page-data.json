There is no support for graphics or multimedia, no support for ham radio, and limited hardware support. I hope to support as much commonly used hardware as possible, so feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>OpenVZ?</strong></p>\n<p>Why does a minimal project such as mindeb use OpenVZ? The answer is simple, its a great way to keep the base host environment as stable as possible, allowing lots of changes to the virtual environment, without the risk of breaking anything fatally.</p>\n<p>I'm not yet sure of the best practices for the virtual environment. I need to do some more testing with squashfs, aufs, and a writable layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Squashfs</strong></p>\n<p>Squashfs remains a great way to compress a file system. Its popular with LiveCD's and is now included in the kernel. Let's hope that LZMA is included soon too!</p>\n<p><strong>Aufs</strong></p>\n<p>I was wondering whether or not to use unionfs or aufs. This <a href=\"http://unionfs.org/\">page</a> has some compelling reasons for aufs. Ironically it is <a href=\"http://unionfs.org/\">unionfs.org</a>! I started with unionfs, then switched to aufs with debian modules, then had trouble using aufs manually, but then finally found a way to make it work. I'm going to stick with aufs for the foreseeable future unless there is a compelling reason to switch back to unionfs.</p>\n<p><strong>Entropy Patch</strong></p>\n<p>This is just a very simple patch to allow entropy to be gathered from network and serial console interrupts.
