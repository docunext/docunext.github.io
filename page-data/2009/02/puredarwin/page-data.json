I installed ircii and connected to irc.freenode.net. I was wondering if I had to muck around with bios or efi.<em>sjc</em> answered a few of my ?s, and I now believe that installing puredarwin to the mini's hdd is a possibility. My goal will be to get puredarwin to be able to build itself, but I'm not sure ifs that is a realistic goal at the moment.I have to refrain from using 10.5, so I'll need to try building puredarwin on 10.4 with XCode 2.x. Hopefully that will work.</p>\n<p>Actually my first goal will be to try and run Puredarwin XMas with QEMU. I'm going to try building the Qemu featured <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/puredarwin.org/puredarwin/developers/qemu\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> on Debian squeeze:</p>\n<pre>\nwget http://www.coresystems.de/~patrick/qemu-r6146.tar.bz2\ntar -xjvf qemu-r6146.tar.bz2sudo apt-get build-dep qemu./configure --disable-gfx-checkmakemake installwget http://xref.puredarwin.org/puredarwinxmas.tar.bz2\ntar -xjvf puredarwinxmas.tar.bz2cd puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm\nqemu-img convert -f vmdk puredarwinxmas.vmdk -O qcow2 puredarwinxmas.qcow2\n/usr/local/bin/qemu -m 512 -vnc :1 -hdb puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -cdrom puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -boot d\n</pre>\n<p>It's building now... so I'll download the XMas image. The last step installs qemu into /usr/local, which works for me. I think I've got it working, and I'm getting a ton of read-only errors from the verbose kernel output. This is interesting! I'm trying again without the -v option. Hmm, that didn't help. Oops I was using the wrong disk identifier for rd=. Its annoying to have to enter \"mach_kernel.voodoo rd=disk1s3 -v\" as a boot option every time.</p>\n<p>Can't figure out the partitioning they are using for the vmdk images. Even if I convert them to raw and use losetup, no valid partition list shows up. Hmmm. Oh wait, gnu fdisk works:</p>\n<pre>\n                               GNU cfdisk 1.2.1                                    Unknown         Disk: /dev/loop0   Disk type: mac    Size: 143654911B, 144MB              Heads: 255   Sectors per track: 63   Cylinders: 17   Number   Flags      Part Type   Filesystem       Label                Size -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      1                Primary     [partition_map]  Apple               0.03MB                        Primary     Free space                           0.69MB      3                Primary     hfs+             PureDarwin           143MB                       Primary     Free space                           0.03MB [ Flags  ] [Make FS ] [ Check  ] [ Rename ] [  Copy  ] [ Resize ] [  Move  ] [ Delete ] [  Type  ] [ Units  ] [ Commit ] [  Quit  ] [  Info  ] [  Help  ]                   Change the flags of the current partition\n</pre>\n<p>Looks like my main problem at the moment is that / is read only. I am able to \"mount -o rw /\" but it still isn't happening. Hmmm. I think it might because my system always considers ISO images as read only. I did a little fiddling to extract the third partition from the iso image:</p>\n<pre>\nlosetup -o 1396736 /dev/loop1 puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.rawdd if=/dev/loop1 of=puredarwin.hfsx bs=16k\n</pre>\n<p>Now I'm trying the kernel rd option as:</p>\n<pre>\nmach_kernel.voodoo rd=disk0s1\n</pre>\n<p>Nope, still getting lots of errors. Looks like linux can r/w hfsplus, but not hfsx. Hmmm. Well I think I might have figured something out.... very strange. XMas darwin isn't starting X because it can't find any screens, so I added -vga vmware, and even though I can't use X, the root is now writable. Odd, huh? I also learned that I can use Xmasdarwin to boot and set rd as nanodarwin. Nice.</p>\n<p>Uh, I don't think it had anything to do with -vga, I guess the journal rebuilds allowed / ro mount rw. So X still wouldn't start automatically, but by typing startx on the bash line, it worked.</p>\n<b>\nTo-Do:\n</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Do this stuff on my debian macbook so I can try out kqemu. I will have to custom build it along with the qemu binary itself. No biggie.</li>\n<li>Get networking operational.</li>\n<li>Use the qemu darwin environment to modify the hfsx partition of a copy of the xmas darwin vmdk image - this is the big one, how should it be modified? For now, I just want to disable X and mDNSresponder.</li>\n<li>Figure out what's up with launchd.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most recent qemu command:</p>\n<pre>\n/usr/local/bin/qemu -m 512 -net user -hda puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -cdrom puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -boot d\n</pre>\n<p>More random notes:</p>\n<pre>\n     Partition info -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Possible partition device: /home/albertlash/src/qemu-r6146/puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.raw3                 Partition type: Primary                 Partition name: PureDarwinXmas        Partition size in bytes: 1292513280B      Partition size in sectors: 2524440s       Portion of the hard disk: 99.9%                Filesystem type: hfsx               System type name: Apple_HFS                       Position: 2728s-2527167s       Start (cyl,heads,sector): 21,1,8         End (cyl,heads,sector): 19743,1,31                          Flags:losetup -o 1396736 /dev/loop1 puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.raw/usr/local/bin/qemu -cpu coreduo -m 512 -vnc :1 -cdrom puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -hda ~/puredarwin.hfsx -boot d/usr/local/bin/qemu -cpu coreduo -m 512 -vnc :1 -vga vmware -net user -hda puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -cdrom puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -boot d/usr/local/bin/qemu -cpu coreduo -m 512 -vnc :1 -net user -hdb puredarwin.iso -cdrom puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm/puredarwinxmas.vmdk -boot d\n</pre>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Puredarwin","date":"February 28th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/02/puredarwin/"}}}
