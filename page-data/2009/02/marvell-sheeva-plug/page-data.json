Its supposed to retail around $100 and from what I can tell, it packs a serious punch.</p>\n<p>It has 512MB of memory and 512MB of NAND flash, so it could run Debian right off the bat, and would also have pretty good performance, as it has a 1GigE network interface, and a 1.2 Ghz ARM9-like CPU core.</p>\n<p>The best part: it only uses 5 watts of power!</p>\n<p>I hope that devices like these continue to decrease in price as much as they have in the past few years. They could really be useful!</p>\n<p>The device can be ordered <a href=\"http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/p-22-sheevaplug-dev-kit.aspx\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/nslu2-killer\">Martin Michlmayr of NSLU2 + Debian fame has posted a blog entry about this</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 2: <a href=\"http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/power-consumption\">Martin shares some power ratings for the sheeva plug</a> - they are terrific - all under 10 watts!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/02/marvell-sheeva-plug/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Marvell Sheeva Plug","date":"February 28th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/02/marvell-sheeva-plug/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
