Its a specialized web server that receives urlencoded JSON formatted SQL queries, parses and executes them, and returns a JSON encoded result set over HTTP. Cool huh? I really wish it returned XML instead, and it looks like that might be a possibility, but I'll have to do some digging and tinkering.</p>\n<p>I'm compiling dbslayer on debian:</p>\n<pre>\ncd /usr/src\nsvn co http://www.dbslayer.org/svn/dbslayer/trunk/ ./dbslayer\napt-get install libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libmysqlclient15-dev./configure\nmake</pre>\n<p>The binary is located in server/dbslayer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/wiki/ConfiguringTheDbslayer\">Configuring the dbslayer</a>.</p>\n<p>Yes, it appears that in more recent versions of dbslayer, it is possible to specify a \"FORMAT\" argument, however it isn't documented well. Furthermore, its appears to be rather inefficient - the result set is first parsed into json and then serialized into xml, instead of just going straight to xml.</p>\n<p>When reading about dbslayer, I found out about mod_ndb. I would really like to combine these two projects!</p>\n<p><strong>What I like about DB Slayer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standalone http server</li>\n<li>Acts as a mysql proxy</li>\n<li>Can perform load balancing</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I like about mod_ndb</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>RESTful interface - all queries are defined as URLs</li>\n<li>Results can be directly output as XML</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another idea is to use <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">Nexista</a> to receive requests and respond with XML or JSON. The idea comes with some side benefits like intelligent caching, security, and a variety of web servers to choose from. But the requirement of PHP and all the extensions is pretty significant.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://www.cherokee-project.com/doc/cookbook_dbslayer.html\">The Cherokee web server has integrated dbslayer as a mysql loadbalancer</a>. Very interesting. Unfortunately, no XML output. :-(</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/02/dbslayer-on-debian/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dbslayer on debian","date":"February 11th, 2009","tags":"debian,mysql,nexista"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/02/dbslayer-on-debian/"}}}
