One problem I have with it is that proftpd ends up only having connections from the gateway ip address, so it does not log the source ip address.</p>\n<p>To do away with the ftp helper and support passive ftp transfers, I found this <a href=\"http://devwiki.pfsense.org/FTPTroubleShooting\" rel=\"nofollow\">pfSense FTP Trouble Shooting page</a> helpful. In a nutshell, I did the following things:</p>\n<ul><li>Disabled the FTP userland helper for all interfaces.</li><li>Specified the masqueraded ip address and a limited port range in /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf</li><li>Port forwarded port 21 and the port range in pfSense to the proftpd server</li></ul>\n<p>It works! I'm planning to install fail2ban now that I have ip addresses I can ban! :-)</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/01/pfsense-proftpd-and-the-ftp-helper/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"pfSense ProFTPd and the FTP Helper","date":"January 7th, 2009","tags":"fail2ban,pfsense"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/01/pfsense-proftpd-and-the-ftp-helper/"}},
