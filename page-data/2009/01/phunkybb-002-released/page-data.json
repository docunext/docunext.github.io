Oops!</p>\n<p>With subversion, thankfully it wasn't a big deal. I tagged and branched <a href=\"http://www.phunkybb.com/trac/browser/branches/phunkybb-0.02\">phunkybb-0.02</a> from yesterday, so all is good. I'll keep maintaining that for bugs, but all new work will be done on the trunk. If 0.02 gets used by a bunch of people, I might copy over non-site_id improvements, but I'd rather focus on the future.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/01/phunkybb-002-released/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PhunkyBB 0.02 Released","date":"January 14th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/01/phunkybb-002-released/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
