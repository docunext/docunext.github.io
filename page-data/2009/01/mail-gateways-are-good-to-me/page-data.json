Just a postfix setup to relay (aka route) mail to different servers. Its kind of like an email firewall in a way. I am keeping some things in mind when configuring mine:* Need to keep an updated list of all recipients behind the gateway to prevent backscatter mail* Perdition!* Need to have a failover</p>\n<p>What are the benefits? Easier administration, especially when it comes to defending against spam: greylisting, spamassassin, and dnsrbls are all consolidated, also making for a more efficient operation. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/01/mail-gateways-are-good-to-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mail Gateways Are Good To Me","date":"January 17th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/01/mail-gateways-are-good-to-me/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
