I've been meaning to try out the NGINX Passenger module, as well as NGINX on FreeBSD. Well, tonight I finally got around to trying out the latter, only to pleasantly discover there is an option for building the Passenger module as well.</p>\n<p>Good thing I scrolled down!! :-)</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">[alert]: Phusion Passenger is disabled because the 'passenger_root' option is not set. Please set this option if you want to enable Phusion Passenger.</pre>\n<p>Next step: activate passenger! And a question - do I have to use RoR? I'd prefer Sinatra... or plain eRuby.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/09/nginx-ports-includes-passenger-option/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NGINX Ports Includes Passenger Option","date":"September 1st, 2009","tags":"freebsd,nginx,ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/nginx-ports-includes-passenger-option/"}},
