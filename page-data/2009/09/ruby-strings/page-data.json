Well one of the nice things about Ruby is that you can do stuff like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">\nclass String\n    def goodbye\n        puts \"Goodbye\"\n    end\nend\nbarf = \"hello\"\nputs barf\nbarf.upcase!\nputs barf\nbarf.goodbye\n</pre>\n<p>Yes, very cool. What happened here was the function goodbye was added to the string class, so that every string object has access to it. Very very cool.</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"http://www.rubyfleebie.com/an-introduction-to-modules-part-1/\">Introduction to Ruby Modules</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby Strings and Real Object Orientation","date":"September 7th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/ruby-strings/"}}}
