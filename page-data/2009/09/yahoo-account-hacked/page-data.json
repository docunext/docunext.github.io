I only found out when one of my friends informed me that I was sending them junk mail. I decided to change my password so hopefully that's the end of that.</p>\n<p>I use to be a little careless giving out my address on web sites and whatnot so I was thinking it could be that coming back to haunt me. On the other hand, I've had this account for a few years so maybe this is just one of those things that's unavoidable.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if anyone out there could give me some pointers on email safety. Like I said I change my password, but is that enough?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/09/yahoo-account-hacked/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yahoo Account Hacked","date":"September 2nd, 2009","tags":"spam,webmail,yahoo"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/yahoo-account-hacked/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
