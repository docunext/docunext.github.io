What about kernels? Linux is amazing, but so is FreeBSD's kernel, and I'm totally thrilled that Debian is on a roll with a distribution based on it: Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.</p>\n<p>I'd love to see Debian embrace OpenSolaris, based upon the good work that Nexenta has done.</p>\n<h2>Debian GNU/kNetBSD</h2>\n<p>But let's take a step back to 2002. There was a debian port to the NetBSD kernel started and it made some serious progress way back then. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, the progress has stalled since 2002.</p>\n<p>When I first learned of this, I figured it wasn't a big deal. I mean, not that many people use NetBSD - its a research operating system, sort of like Minix, right?</p>\n<p>Then I learned about NetBSD and Xen.</p>\n<h2>NetBSD and Xen</h2>\n<p>I'm no expert on Xen <strong>or</strong> NetBSD, but from what I've read, NetBSD 5.0.1 and Xen rock the party that rocks the party.</p>\n<p>Why is that important for Debian? I'm not sure if its super important for debian, but I'm certain that Xen and virtualization in general is super important for this world.</p>\n<p>Virtualized machines are probably the coolest thing I've encountered since learning about debian a few years back, and I feel like we're at the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>I'm a little frustrated now that I'm not making a better case for why work on Debian GNU/kNetBSD should continue. Ah well, I'm getting distracted with a Debian GNU/Hurd virtual machine I'm trying to update. In good time, I'll support my position on Debian GNU/kNetBSD.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBSD#Virtualization_with_Xen\">NetBSD Virtualization with Xen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.netbsd.se/How_to_set_up_a_guest_OS_using_xen3\">NetBSD Xen Wiki Page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.netbsd.org/ports/xen/howto.html\">NetBSD Xen Howto</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/09/a-case-for-debian-gnuknetbsd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Case for Debian GNU kNetBSD","date":"September 9th, 2009","tags":"debian,netbsd"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/a-case-for-debian-gnuknetbsd/"}},
