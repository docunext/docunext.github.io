Well the j in jQuery stands for Javascript, at this point I thought my assumption was correct but the name is actually quite misleading.  Although they both have the java name in common and they're both programming languages they are really very different and quite unrelated. </p>\n<p>But anyways for those of you still wondering what jQuery is I'll fill you in.  jQuery is  lightweight <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library\" title=\"JavaScript library\">JavaScript library</a> that emphasizes interaction between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" title=\"JavaScript\">JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" title=\"HTML\">HTML</a>.  So it is basically a reference guide that gives you templates of sorts with pre written JavaScript.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/09/jquery-jeditconnection/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"jQuery jEdit...Connection","date":"September 25th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/jquery-jeditconnection/"}},
