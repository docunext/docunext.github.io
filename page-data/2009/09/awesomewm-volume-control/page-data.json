I wish the fn-keys worked.... that would certainly make things easier.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/09/awesomewm-volume-control/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AwesomeWM Volume Control","date":"September 2nd, 2009","tags":"awesomewm,gnome"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/09/awesomewm-volume-control/"}}}
