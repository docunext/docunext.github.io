I've been making serious progress on 0.3 lately and I am going to start rolling out the subversion trunk to a few low-traffic forum sites for preliminary testing.</p>\n<p>User rights still need work - as I'm not sure how I want to handle users that register for multiple boards that use the same database. It might be advantageous to allow users to maintain the same passwords across boards, but I don't want registration on one board to grant permissions across all accessible boards. So, there is obviously more development to do, but the major hurdles for multi-site support are good to go.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/04/03-closer-than-i-thought/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"0.3 Closer than I thought","date":"April 7th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/04/03-closer-than-i-thought/"}},
