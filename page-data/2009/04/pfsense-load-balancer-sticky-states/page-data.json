Previously it would log me out randomly, because the load balancer had switched backends.</p>\n<p>Hmmm, its very strange because it just switched again. I wish I knew why it was not remaining a sticky connection. The blurb doc says as long as there is a connection, it stays sticky. Hence the keepalive, but its apparently not working. :-(</p>\n<p>Aha - I think I may have figured it out. I was connecting to other back-ends through the load balancer which had different keepalive settings. I wish the keepalive settings worked.</p>\n<p>There are many facets to this situation: http keepalive, tcp keepalive, pf states, proxies, and more I'm not thinking of at the moment. Its very interesting though.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/04/pfsense-load-balancer-sticky-states/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"pfSense Load Balancer Sticky States","date":"April 14th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/04/pfsense-load-balancer-sticky-states/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
