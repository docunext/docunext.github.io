AT&#x26;T had major communications problems due to two of their fiber optics cables being cut, apparently by vandals.</p>\n<p>This is not a small issue. All communications were down for AT&#x26;T - land line telephones and mobile phone services. Why in the world would someone want to prevent people from communicating?</p>\n<p>I have to imagine that it was a sophisticated, coordinated effort, as multiple lines were reportedly cut. I imagine that the criminals must have known that they were cutting AT&#x26;T wires, the probability that both cables were inadvertently AT&#x26;T's network is highly unlikely.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/04/networking-vandals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Networking Vandals","date":"April 9th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/04/networking-vandals/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
