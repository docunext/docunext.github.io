Why do I have a setup like this? I use Apache for complicated stuff. NGINX for handling connections, \"routing\", static files, and compression. Varnish for connections, routing, and caching.</p>\n<p>I'll post more details as I collect them.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/04/the-impact-of-proxies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Latency Impact of HTTP Proxies","date":"April 14th, 2009","tags":"nginx,proxies,varnish"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/04/the-impact-of-proxies/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
