Given that Google can generate a lot of traffic for a new website, its important to know how sites are added to the Google index and what can affect where it appears in the search results for a user inquiry.</p>\n<p>The problem is that not everyone wants to take the time (myself included) to learn how best to present a website to Google and other search engines so that its content and quality is accurately reflected.</p>\n<p>During my experience as a web master, I've learned to do the following things when published websites to ensure that they are included in search engines:</p>\n<ul><li>Examine robots.txt to make sure that search engines are allowed to crawl and index the site</li><li>Make sure that the webserver isn't trying to set cookies or start sessions for the web crawlers</li><li>Use descriptive language in links</li><li>Use Google Webmaster tools</li><li>Use a sitemap</li></ul>This list just scratches the surface though.
