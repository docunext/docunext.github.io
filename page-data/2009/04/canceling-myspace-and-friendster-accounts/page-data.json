Why? Actually for many reasons.</p>\n<ul><li>They don't provide the level of privacy I would like.</li><li>MySpace has an obnoxious amount of advertisements.</li><li>Friendster has always behaved in a \"buggy\" manner when I use it.</li></ul>While I was at it, I drastically increased my Facebook privacy settings. Its not so much that I don't want people to be able to know who I am, but more that I do not want websites to publish information about me without my permission. Yes, its a control thing. I have am technically capable and even have a personal blog. If someone needs to find out information about me, I'd rather they go to the source, rather than some untrusted third party.\n<p>I also contacted Spoke to demand that they remove the pictures and text about me that they are reproducing without my permission. In this case, <a href=\"http://www.informedlicensing.com/blog/copyright/\">copyright</a> comes in handy.</p>\n<p>Its for reasons like these that made the Facebook Licensing Agreement so absurd. If they didn't return to the prior reasonable terms, I would have removed a lot of the data that I had uploaded, and simply linked to it from there.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/04/canceling-myspace-and-friendster-accounts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Canceling MySpace and Friendster Accounts","date":"April 15th, 2009","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/04/canceling-myspace-and-friendster-accounts/"}},
