It's been ported to several other blog engines and general purposes, but all the ports which I have seen retained the same or slightly varied Actionscript 3 codebase.</p>\n<p>I was really impressed with WP-Cumulus when I first found it, so much that I tried to incorporate it into a project I was working on. My initial attempts were curtailed by the fact that it is apparently impossible (according to Adobe) to import version 9 swf files into swf files of previous versions. Since I was using a previous version as my primary swf format, I gave up.</p>\n<p>The reason why I was using a previous swf format is due to ming. In my humble opinion, ming rocks!</p>\n<p>But what about Haxe? It apparently can bridge the swf format version divide. I've been reading up on it the past few days, and converting the open source WP-Cumulus project to Haxe seems like an manageable opportunity to do something really cool while learning about Actionscript 3 and Haxe.</p>\n<p>Let's get started! As a second step, I'm following the <a href=\"http://haxe.org/doc/start/flash/as3migration\">guidelines on the Haxe website to migrate AS3 to Haxe</a>. My first step was to try and compile as3tohaxe, but I hit a wall with <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2009/11/could-not-find-module-textparsecexpr/\">\"Could not find module `Text.Parsec.Expr': \"</a>. If I can eventually get it to compile, I certainly give it a try, but in the meantime, I'll go the manual route with WP-Cumulus.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Notes</strong></p>\n<p>This:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_javascript\">\nimport flash.net.navigateToURL;\n</pre>\n<p>doesn't work for me for some reason,.</p>\n<p>I'm also having trouble with XML / String / Arrays - can the Flash compiler deal with multi-types / on-the-fly casting?</p>\n<p><strong>Sup w/ Sort?</strong></p>\n<p>AS3:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_javascript\">\n// mix up the list so not all a' live on the north pole\nmcList.sort( function(){ return Math.random()<0.5 ? 1 : -1; } );\n</pre>\n<p>Haxe:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_javascript\">\n// mix up the list so not all a' live on the north pole\nmcList.sort(\n    function(mcList,mcList):Int {\n        //return Math.random()<0.5 ? 1 : -1;\n        var myr:Float = Math.random();\n        if(myr == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        } else if (myr<0.5) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return -1;\n        }\n    }\n);\n</pre>\n<p>There are some clear differences between Haxe and AS3, and this is one of them. When I first tried compiling the AS3 code, haxe replied with:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\n./Cloud.hx:83: characters 21-69 : Void -> Int should be flash.display.MovieClip -> flash.display.MovieClip -> Int\n</pre>\n<p>Huh? What's that mean? The Haxe Array API docs define the Array.sort function like so:</p>\n<blockquote>\nfunction sort( f : T -> T -> Int ) : Void\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do the f, T, and Int items mean? In this case, the f specifies that the sort function takes a function as its argument (aka lambda or anonymous functions), and \"T -> T -> Int\" specifies that the function should take whatever type of objects the array is holding (integers, strings, or in this case MovieClips) as the first two arguments, and return an integer.</p>\n<p>Related:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.haxe.code-experiments.com/blog/2009/11/flash-as3-example-with-addeventlistener.html\">http://www.haxe.code-experiments.com/blog/2009/11/flash-as3-example-with-addeventlistener.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://remixtechnology.com/view/astar-haxe\">http://remixtechnology.com/view/astar-haxe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/Array.html#sort()\">http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/Array.html#sort()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://haxe.org/api/array\">http://haxe.org/api/array</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3654\">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3654</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lists.motion-twin.com/pipermail/haxe/2009-May/024905.html\">http://lists.motion-twin.com/pipermail/haxe/2009-May/024905.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lists.motion-twin.com/pipermail/haxe/2008-April/016181.html\">http://lists.motion-twin.com/pipermail/haxe/2008-April/016181.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://asserttrue.com/articles/2006/08/07/haxe-found\">http://asserttrue.com/articles/2006/08/07/haxe-found</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Converting WP Cumulus to Haxe","date":"November 21st, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/11/converting-wp-cumulus-to-haxe/"}}}
