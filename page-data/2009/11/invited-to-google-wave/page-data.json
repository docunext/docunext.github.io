As a potential GW developer, my interest has waned, but I did login to check it out.</p>\n<p>My first impression was that the interface didn't look so good on my machine. It looked a lot like a clunky GMail. Also, I really don't like that GMail has instant messenger / chat. Maybe some people do, but I really don't - I never feel like I can fully turn it off. When I noticed something similar was \"on\" in Google Wave, I lost a lot of interest. I do have to ask the question why Microsoft, and now Google, are working so hard to change email as we know it?</p>\n<p>I'm sure my curiosity will recover and I'll look into Wave again, but for now, <a href=\"http://pushmodule.slact.net/\">NGINX as a \"Comet\" server</a> sounds more interesting to me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Invited to Google Wave","date":"November 30th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/11/invited-to-google-wave/"}}}
