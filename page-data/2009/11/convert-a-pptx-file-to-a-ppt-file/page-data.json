Unfortunately, older, but still recent, versions of Powerpoint are unable to open pptx files.</p>\n<p>Thankfully OpenOffice, a free and open source office productivity tool, can open and save in both formats. Today I used \"ooimpress\" to do just that. The only problem I had was due to a missing font, so I simply made some adjustments and saved in the ppt format.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I just received confirmation that the Windows user who was unable to open the .pptx file was able to open the .ppt file that I converted with OpenOffice!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/11/convert-a-pptx-file-to-a-ppt-file/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Convert a .pptx File to a .ppt File","date":"November 19th, 2009","tags":"microsoft,openoffice"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/11/convert-a-pptx-file-to-a-ppt-file/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
