It works really well!</p>\n<p>Previously I'd used squid2, and this time I used squid3. I was very pleased with how I was able to easily specify proxy / \"routing\" rules for different domains. I noted how Squid also has very good configuration support for access controls and dns resolvers.</p>\n<p>All this made me wonder why Squid, which is an incredibly powerful <em>forward</em> proxy, bothers to support reverse proxy features at all? To reverse proxy, I use NGINX, Pound, Apache, and Varnish.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, I have to wonder why Apache supports forward proxy features? Seems to me its really a non-feature, even more of a security risk than anything else. If I recall correctly, the forward proxy features are disabled by default, which is a good thing!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/11/questions-about-squid-and-apache/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Questions about Squid and Apache","date":"November 10th, 2009","tags":"apache,nginx,proxies,squid,varnish"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/11/questions-about-squid-and-apache/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
