Meaning they start with &#x3C;html> and end with &#x3C;/html> (or something like that)? In other words, you can open the file in a browser and it will display the entire page.</p>\n<p>SSI and XSL will let us break the html files up into templates in a manageable way. If we opened up an XSL or SSI file, it would only show part of the page.</p>\n<p>It is very popular for people to use HTML or XHTML with CSS. That is what the browser \"reads\" when it displays the page. The browser / user / visitor side of things is usually called the \"client side\", and the server, aptly called the \"server side\". Javascript renders on the client-side, which is good is some instances. Most other software processes on the server side, before information is transmitted to the client side.</p>\n<p>On the server and developer side of things, we can use SSI or XSL to output a complete HTML document from different pieces of HTML code. For example, it is common to use these types of template pieces:</p>\n<p>main or overall template</p>\n<p>header</p>\n<p>menu</p>\n<p>body</p>\n<p>footer</p>\n<p>sidebar</p>\n<p>That way, if we decide to change the menu for every page, we can do so, without having to update every html file. Usually what happens is there is a main template, which imports the other pieces of code to make the finished product.</p>\n<p>I like to describe Nexista, the XSLT processor we use, like that Indian god with many arms, Kali. When a user requests a certain page, Kali will grab all the different template components to build that page, and then hand over the combination of them all - a complete html document. </blockquote></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/01/ssi-and-xslt-explanation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SSI and XSLT Explanation","date":"January 22nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/01/ssi-and-xslt-explanation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
