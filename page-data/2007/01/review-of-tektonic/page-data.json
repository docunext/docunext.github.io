Instead, I got RHEL. I tried to remedy the situation by resetting the server but now cannot get any access to the Virtuozzo Panel or ssh with original or changed password. Password reset does not work either.\n<p>Sorry I don't have time to keep working on it, I have to cancel my account for a refund. Maybe once you have things more stable I'll consider coming back.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>It is surprising though that they have pretty good customer support beyond that. They responded to my ticket in the morning and refunded my payment.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/01/review-of-tektonic/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Review of Tektonic","date":"January 30th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/01/review-of-tektonic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
