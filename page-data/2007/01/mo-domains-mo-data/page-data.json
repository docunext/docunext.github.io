Great topic to bring up on a first data, I mean date. Just kidding.

I've searched for way to better manage my domain names, and feel like this is the answer:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.secondversion.com/domain-port/\">Doman Name Portfolio - A better way to manage your domain names</a></p>\n<p>I think its designed for public access, but I'll just keep it private as a database. MyDnsConfig ends up being good for it, I'll need to add a few fields to the soa table, but its what I need for now.</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, even General Electric is still registering domain names. They bought teenmoviescene.com in October 2006, and mention it on 30 Rock - saying they gave a the \"Rural Juror\" 5 ipods. Unfortunately they aren't doing anything with it.
