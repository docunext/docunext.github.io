I'm interested to hear what people are saying about Quark. It appears that I'm not using it for the right purpose. It handles vector graphics any layout well but cannot handle the page concept. It seems like it should be able to deal with Acrobat PDF files well because it can open them OK, but it simply cannot save them properly. It is rediculous that I can't print a multiple page Post Script file!</p>\n<p>I am very impressed with Mac OS 9's Adobe Distiller Program. This is needed on the Mac OS X. This program is mainly good for creating and managing vector artwork. If you try to do more than this, you will get a headache!!What are the differences between 10 and Illustrator CS?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/01/adobe-illustrator-notes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adobe Illustrator Notes","date":"January 21st, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/01/adobe-illustrator-notes/"}},
