I chose the Corsair 1GB USB drive and installed Debian on it using the guided partitioning method, 1 partition, and no root account. The choice of using no root account has proven problematic, because the system clocks are set to 2003, and \"sudo su\" produces an error. Not a big deal, but annoying nonetheless. To work around this, I booted into single user mode, set the system clock,  then set the hardware clock to the system clock and rebooted into normal mode.  Upon reboot, sudo su worked fine.  :-)</p>\n<p>I've also updated /etc/fstab to include the following:</p>\n<pre>tmpfs           /etc/network/run tmpfs defaults,noatime                   0 0\n\ntmpfs           /tmp           tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0\n\ntmpfs           /var/lock      tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0\n\ntmpfs           /var/log       tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0\n\ntmpfs           /var/run       tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0\n\ntmpfs           /var/tmp       tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0</pre>\n<p>Thanks to: <a href=\"http://feraga.com/node/30\">http://feraga.com/node/30</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debian on USB","date":"May 21st, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/05/debian-on-usb/"}}}
