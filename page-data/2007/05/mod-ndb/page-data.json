It creates a direct connection from an Apache Web server to the NDB data nodes in a MySQL Cluster (bypassing mysqld, and eliminating the need to create or parse SQL queries). This allows you to query and modify a database over HTTP using GET, POST, and DELETE requests, and retrieve results in a variety of formats, including JSON results that can go 'direct to the browser' in an Ajax application. Mod</em>ndb is also scriptable, using Apache's subrequest API, so that complex multi-table transactions or joins (even including sort-merge join plans that are currently not possible in MySQL) can be easily created in PHP or Perl.</blockquote></p>\n<p>This reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.thomas-bayer.com/rest-demo.htm\">sqlrest demo</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/05/mod-ndb/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"mod ndb","date":"May 11th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/05/mod-ndb/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
