Totally awesome! The company is backed by Google and Sequoia. I like this idea as it makes the internet a much more ubiquitous and affordable (and hopefully faster) entity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS7927748666.html\">DIY MythTV STB</a> - We're trying to build a MythTV box at the moment, based on Debian Etch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9073106297.html\">The Zonbu</a> device uses the VIA C7! I just got an email response from the Zonbu team about how the Zonbu comes pre-installed with a distribution optimized for its hardware, which I believe is Gentoo. They also mentioned that it incorporates their self-healing architecture. I believe that means the subscription network, which I think is a good idea for many but not for me. I prefer to be the one in control of my hardware.</p>\n<p>Gentoo is a good choice because it is specifically designed to systematically make use of special gcc optimization flags. However, for the most part, these flags will not have a significant impact on the type of setups I am planning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://linux.jjplus.com/index.html\">LinkGear Series 100</a> - 2Watt network appliance with 2 10/100 RJ-45 ethernet ports</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX53&aisle_id=799\">The ICOP  eBox-3853 Dual LAN, rear-accessible CF slot</a> is a pretty awesome machine too.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/05/linux-devices/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Devices","date":"May 13th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/05/linux-devices/"}}}
