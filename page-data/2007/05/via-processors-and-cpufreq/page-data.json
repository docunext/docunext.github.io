I've been trying to figure out more about how to get acpi processor frequency scaling with them. Here's been my experience so far. <b>C3</b></p>\n<p>I've heard that the longhaul driver works for the ASUS Terminator C3. Unfortunately I just tried it and it didn't work:</p>\n<pre>insmod /lib/modules/2.6.15-28-386/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longrun.ko\n\ninsmod: error inserting '.../longrun.ko': -1 No such device</pre>\n<p>Duh. I just spent the afternoon compiling longhaul, but then try to insmod longrun. I just insmodded longhaul and it works! :-) Unfortunately, when the processor is at its lowest frequency (400Mhz) I get this high pitched whine coming from the computer. I just installed powertweak to see if I can omit that cpu frequency from the cpu frequency adjusting daemon. If that doesn't work, I'll try to modify the scaling_available_frequencies file (though I'll probably have to do that every restart?). Powertweakd is a lot more than I need to simply alter the available frequencies. I'm instead using the cpufrequtils file in /etc/default to raise the minimum frequency to 532000 so that the cpu won't emit that annoying high pitched whine. <b>C7</b></p>\n<p>There is some new code for the C7 in the testing linux kernel, but for me, the acpi-cpufreq driver worked on my Everex NC1500 notebook. I think the C7 version is actually \"e_powersaver.ko\". Hmmm, doesn't seem like that one is supported by the C7-D. Grrr.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.telia.com/~u18801979/\"><a href=\"http://web.telia.com/~u18801979/\">http://web.telia.com/~u18801979/</a></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.aspx?catid=28&threadid=77689&enterthread=y\">No frequency scaling for C7?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.aspx?catid=28&threadid=76102&highlight_key=y&keyword1=cpufreq\">Supposed longhaul driver fix for C7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cpufreq/5139\" rel=\"nofollow\">GMANE message about 65Mhz VIA bug</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://osdir.com/ml/kernel.cpufreq/2007-01/msg00073.html\">acpi-cpufreq reports 65mhz</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7880\">acpi-cpufreq reports wrong frequency bug report at kernel.org bugzilla</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.aspx?catid=28&threadid=77144&highlight_key=y&keyword1=c7-d\">Freq scaling possible through p-states?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.aspx?catid=32&threadid=74486&enterthread=y\">VIA C7 Uses ACPI P-States to vary frequecncy</a></p>\n<p>Now I'm trying to install gutsy gibbons, see if that helps any. For what its worth, here's a screenshot of the PC Chips motherboard BIOS:</p>\n<p>I guess the kernel just isn't quite ready for the C7. From the stuff I've found, it looks like there are three potential candidates for cpufreq drivers for the C7:</p>\n<ul><li>acpi-cpufreq (hasn't worked for me) read reports it would work</li><li>longhaul - again, didn't work for me, got an error saying C3 Esther doesn't support frequency scaling. ???</li><li>e_powersave - read somewhere that this won't work with the C7-D</li></ul><b>EDEN</b>\n<p>I have a few C7 EDEN chips to try this out on, but haven't yet: <a href=\"http://www.swintabletennis.com/blog/?p=22\">VIA EPIA EN 12000EG Linux kernel compile on Ubuntu</a>.
