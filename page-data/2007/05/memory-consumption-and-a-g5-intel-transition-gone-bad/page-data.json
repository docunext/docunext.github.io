I found the ATI Monitor, it was being started in the User Login Items. I removed it by loading up the system preferences, selecting my user, then login items, then selecting \"ATI Monitor\" then clicking the minus sign (-) at the bottom. Now a restart is called for. OK, no more ATI Monitor, but I noticed Universal Access using 4MB of RAM. What's that? Some goofy bellwhistle that Apple added for giggles - see this thread about <a href=\"http://forums.macnn.com/90/mac-os-x/336608/universal-access-app/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Universal Access App and how to turn it off</a>.\n<p>How about the \"pbs\" process? I searched for \"pbs mac os x system process\" which reveals that it is the paste board server, documented by Apple. I'll keep the pbs process going. Looks like ATSServer is legit too. Now what about DiskImages UI Agent? Or loginagent? I quit DiskImages UI Agent and everything seems OK. I think that is the process that runs to pay attention to when you insert a disk. I don't do that enough to merit its using 5MB of RAM. Though I do use USB flash drives from time to time. Just tested it, and it works fine without DiskImages UI Agent running. I think I need the diskimages-helper process running though. This looks a lot better, let's see how well unison runs now:</p>\n<p>Unison is still running poorly compared to my Macbook.
