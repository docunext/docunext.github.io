It was slicehost.com, and they provide virtual private servers at a premium, but their level of service makes all the difference. Why'd I cancel then?</p>\n<p>I recently obtained a second Comcast Business account for another location, and when I did so, I requested 13 IP addresses. I'm going to use those instead.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Slicehost was very graceful with our cancellation, even refunded our last automatic payment which was processed a few days prior to their notice about the IP transition. If they hadn't I would have put up a stink, so they saved us both some trouble. The moral of this story? If I opt for virtual private hosting again, I'll choose Slicehost.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/05/slicehost/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slicehost","date":"May 30th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/05/slicehost/"}}}
