Not a website where you can bookmark stuff, but a network service that will publish your bookmarks to a client, like a browser, for quick access, and url-completion (like in your history). This would kind of be like an LDAP-based address book.</p>\n<p>One way to accomplish something like this would be through the use of Bonjour, because some browsers have a listener for it, like Camino. Doing a little digging I found this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dns-sd.org/\">DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)</a></p>\n<p>DNS Service Discovery appears to possibly be what I'm looking for.
