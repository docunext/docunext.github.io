It works as described, though I didn't test it out too extensively. I ran it on a debian machine, and had it listen on a two different ips. Nmap didn't seem to have much trouble with it, but trying to access that virtual ip with ssh or a web client would result in an incredible long timeout. That is very interesting.</p>\n<p>I got to thinking whether it really was a useful mechanism though. Would a well designed firewall ruleset do the trick? It might be more useful if you have a ton of IP addresses which can be used as a tarpit, but in my case where I only have a few, it might not make sense.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/labrea-tarpit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"LaBrea Tarpit","date":"November 19th, 2007","tags":"debian,nmap"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/labrea-tarpit/"}},
