When I try to login or reset my password with my customer number, they say it is unknown. Great. (sarcasm)</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I had to get my customer number emailed to me <b>for each and every batch of private registrations I had purchased</b>, the number was different for each one. What a pain. Then I had to reset the password for each one. Ugh, finally I'm free of what I'm now going to refer to as the \"GoDaddy Privacy Snare\", because that's what it felt like to me. I was offered something for free, but then had to work to get out of it. I should have known better. Oh well.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/more-godaddy-woes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MORE GoDaddy Woes","date":"November 3rd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/more-godaddy-woes/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
