Hate to admit it, but its so much better, I've never looked back.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, wake-on-lan is pretty finicky. There are many different things that must work together to get it going. While its definitely possible, using an external switch to turn on a machine is so much easier.</p>\n<p>To do that, all you need is a network accessible outlet controller, and set your BIOS to turn on after a power failure.
