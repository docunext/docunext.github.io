I just had to clear it of all it's old data. I inserted an install CD and held down C as I rebooted. When the machine restarted it had the following screen.<a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/p1010224.JPG\" title=\"Startup Image\" class=\"thickbox\">\n<img style=\"padding: 10px; float: left;\" img=\"\" src=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/p1010224.thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"Startup Image\" /></a> I had put in the wrong install disc for the machine which is what I believe caused the error.</p>\n<p>I was a little irritated that during the setup process of the machine it forces you to register with mac, however it let me put in completely fake data, so it's not really that big a deal. Not to mention I'm simply delighted to have a functioning machine again.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/g4-reformat-and-install/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"G4 reformat and install","date":"November 16th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/g4-reformat-and-install/"}}}
