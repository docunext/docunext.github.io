I have a pc at home, but often used a Mac for work related projects.</p>\n<p>I honestly wouldn't say I enjoy one over the other.  Its like comparing apples and oranges (no pun intended).  One's not better than the other, they're just different.  Some prefer one, while others like them both.  I thinks it usually boils down to what you want your computer to do for you.  A mac is often geared more towards designing and working with graphics, while a PC has other tasks it is better suited for.</p>\n<p>Once you find out what your computer will primarily be used for I think you can then assess the pros and cons of each machine and decide which is better equipped to handle your needs.  Right off the bat, I'll tell you that I'm a gamer so I would probably go for the PC, but If I was a graphic designer (what I'm going to school for) then I would most likely purchase a Mac.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/mac-or-pc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac or PC","date":"November 21st, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/mac-or-pc/"}},
