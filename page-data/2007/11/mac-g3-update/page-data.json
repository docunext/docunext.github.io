Apple deals with the issue by replacing the motherboard to the tune of $429. A little steep to be fixing a five year old machine.</p>\n<p>Luckily the mac doc spoke frankly with me and said \"theoretically\" I can solder the piece back to the motherboard. This weekend is Frankenstein time for the little machine. Confounding the issue  a bit I thought it would be easy to find the soldering fix for the iBook G3 on line, (when I replaced my ipod battery I found instructions easily enough) however<a href=\"http://www.macbook-fr.com/ibook/demontage/ibook_dual_usb_article18.html?page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the only site I could find</a> with pictures detailing the fix for the laptop is in French. I guess I'll have to have the translator open as I do the procedure.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/mac-g3-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac G3 Update","date":"November 9th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/mac-g3-update/"}},
