By disabling ACPI, it boots OK, so I did some searching for information on how to disable ACPI for every boot. I found that this is possible by adding:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nhint.acpi.0.disabled=\"1\"\n</pre>\n<p>to the end of /boot/device.hints from the diagnostics -> edit file menu option.</p>\n<p>I'm now using the most recent build of pfSense (1.2-RC3) on several machines and I'm very pleased with the results.</p>\n<p>The cool thing about this mini-project was that I was able to replace a VPN gateway router which was running on debian without too much trouble. I was a little nervous about doing that, especially remotely, but it worked out well. I first created a third VLAN on my Cisco router for a new subnet, just in case I wasn't able to do the switch. Then I moved the current gateway address, keeping the public WAN address active. Then I switched in the lan ip of the new pfsense vpn firewall router, setup IPSec and tested it to make sure it was OK. Then I made the LAN nic of the old VPN server a dhcp client, tested it, then did the same for its wan port, and added the port on the cisco switch to the second VLAN.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it all worked! :-)</p>\n<p>Thanks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/laptop/article.html\">http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/laptop/article.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/HOWTO_disable_acpi\">http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/HOWTO_disable_acpi</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/disable-acpi-in-pfsense/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disable ACPI in pfSense","date":"November 29th, 2007","tags":"acpi,intel,pfsense"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/disable-acpi-in-pfsense/"}}}
