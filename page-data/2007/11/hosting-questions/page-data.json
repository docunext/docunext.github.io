Most affordable hosts are shared, and most of the time its not a problem, but with every shared host I've ever worked with there always has been a problem.\n<p>On the flip side, virtual private hosting can fix that with by limiting resources to each clients share of a server, without needing to have each client on a separate server - few websites have a need for that. Still though, vps has its problems too, because each vps to be a real vps needs a publicly routable IP address.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/hosting-questions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hosting Questions","date":"November 9th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/hosting-questions/"}}}
