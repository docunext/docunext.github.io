I eventually want to use NAT, but to do so at this time would require some fairly extensive routing tables, which I don't want to worry about.</p>\n<p>In this case, the nice thing about mod_proxy, is that I don't have to worry about the routing tables! But there are other benefits. For example, I am using SSL to connect to the public proxy, and from there I am using plain http, since the secondary network is private. I think this is how many SSL off-loaders work.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/finally-using-mod-proxy-in-production/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finally Using mod proxy in production","date":"November 28th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/finally-using-mod-proxy-in-production/"}},
