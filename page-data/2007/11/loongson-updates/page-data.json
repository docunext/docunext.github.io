It is going to be more expensive that it should be, considering the amount of power it puts out. With much cheaper alternatives like the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/06/intel-little-valley-photos/\">intel little valley d201gly</a>, energy prices will have to rise quite a bit to make it worthwhile to use the loongsong. Another alternative are Geode LX700 and LX800 system boards. These chips are x86 compatible and only consume a trickle of power. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/26/alix/\">ALIX</a> only consumes 5 watts of power. The VIA C7 is also x86 compatible and another good choice.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/loongson-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Loongson Updates","date":"November 2nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/loongson-updates/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
