So I've been procrastinating the undertaking of the debian policy manual, by doing stuff like writing this post! :-)</p>\n<p>But I did scratch the surface today. I've been trying to communicate with debian people so that I can get a feel for how it works. The feeling I got was that the debian manuals are actually really good. Even based upon the little bit I've read so far, I have to agree. What really pleased me is that a lot of what goes on in \"apt\" is what the policies are about - from main, contrib, and non-free, to priority ratings. Its amazing how useful theory can be from time to time.</p>\n<p>What's new to me? A lot, but for starters, the maintainer scripts. I'm still getting my mind wrapped around automation, and although I like it, it does take a fair bit of premeditation while I tend to be an experiencer.</p>\n<p>Again I'll put the policy manual on the shelf, accepting the fact that one of the skills I need to improve is shell scripting. I'm not bad at it, but I'm just not good either. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/debian-policies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Policies","date":"November 14th, 2007","tags":"debian"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/debian-policies/"}},
