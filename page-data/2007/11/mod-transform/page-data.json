There are a couple of interesting features - XSL caching, the ability to turn on / off the module announcement (compare that to mod_xslt!), and the ability to map any includes to the webserver documentroot. Oh how that has bugged the heck out of me in my work with <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">nexista</a>! It uses the same xslt library as php, but as <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/10/apache2-xslt/#comment-4044\">niq points out, without the overhead</a>.</p>\n<p>Question though, what's the mod_transform license?</p>\n<p>UPDATE November 3, 2007: I am having problems with mod_transform and http caching. If neither the xml nor the xsl document has been modified since the last request, Apache sends a 304 response, but for some reason, the browser gets a 200 response, and fails. Not sure what the problem is though. I just set the Apache header to no-store, and no-cache, and its working now, so I guess you just can't use modification times. I remember reading something about that for server side includes. If you are going to have static-enough data, you might as well render it to html, or use a proxy cache of sorts.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/mod-transform/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"mod transform","date":"November 1st, 2007","tags":"apache,xml,xsl"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/mod-transform/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
