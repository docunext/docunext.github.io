I was also able to install the spam filter and sitemap plugins - so cool. One of these days should really consider getting an akismet key, but I'm also very interested in using mod_defensible and/or mod_ifier to block comment spam.</p>\n<p>UPDATE November 10, 2007: I had an issue with the base_url not being prepended to the url/loc nodes, so I did some investigating and found that my conf/trac.ini files were missing the base_url parameter in the general [trac] config section. Not sure how I got away with that omission for so long, but at least its fixed now. :-)</p>\n<p>Without further ado, some links:</p>\n<p><a  rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter\"><a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter\">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter</a></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GoogleSitemapPlugin\" rel=\"nofollow\"><a href=\"http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GoogleSitemapPlugin\">http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GoogleSitemapPlugin</a></a></p>\n<p>Next up:</p>\n<p><a  rel=\"nofollow\"  href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MySqlDb\"><a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MySqlDb\">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MySqlDb</a></a></p>\n<p>(Before I convert my trac db's to mysql, I'm going to convert my main webserver, the one that powers this site, to use fast_cgi instead of using a php module. I prefer that method as it allows me to use the Apache mpm worker instead of the mpm prefork.)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/trac-webadmin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trac WebAdmin","date":"November 10th, 2007","tags":"apache,mysql,python,spam,trac"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/trac-webadmin/"}},
