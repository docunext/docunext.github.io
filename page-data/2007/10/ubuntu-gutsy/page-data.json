I installed it on an AMD system, and now I'm trying again on intel, but I'm using a 2GB CF card and it doesn't want to fit. Hmmmm.</p>\n<p>I just switched to reiserfs to see if that might help. Nope, guess you need more than 2GB of storage.</p>\n<p>On my new Gutsy machine, I'm using the nvidia proprietary driver to power a 1680x1050 lcd display - and it really looks awesome. The LCD is connected to the graphics card via a DVI cable for digital quality images. I tried setting up a second monitor just like the first over a VGA cable, and although I was able to get it operational, I was no longer able to get the compiz interface effects happening.</p>\n<p>I also tried to use an intel board with the onboard graphics adapter, but that wasn't happening at all. I guess there are some ongoing issues with the X3000 / 965 GMA chipset driver, which is too bad as that was one of the first high performance, open source video drivers by a major manufacturer.</p>\n<p>I'm on the fence about where to go from here. I have a RAGE 128MB PCI card which I might install in the existing machine to try and get both LCD monitors working with interface effects, but I don't want to push my luck. I may end up setting up something totally different on the second display, and connect the two via synergy - the keyboard and mouse sharing utility.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome, I'm really pleased with Ubuntu Gutsy. My recent rants about how I like debian better aside, interface effects make a huge difference! :-)</p>\n<p>UPDATE October 26, 2007: I tried installing Gutsy on an Everex NC1501 today but the installer CD had issues with the LCD / graphics driver, even in safe mode. I'm sure there's a trick to it...</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/10/ubuntu-gutsy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu Gutsy Rocks","date":"October 25th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/10/ubuntu-gutsy/"}},
