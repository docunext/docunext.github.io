The software used to run the PEAR server is a little buggy, but it is advertised as alpha and for the most part it works. I then packaged up the most current version of nexista and uploaded it. I had to add, change, and edit maintainers and stuff, but it worked in the end. Now I've got to polish it up a bit and then I'll make it public.</p>\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n<p>So I messed up a bunch of stuff when I did this yesterday, so I did it again today, and it worked out much better. I was able to upload a release, and even discover it from another machine!</p>\n<pre>pear channel-discover pear.nexista.org/pear/\n\nAdding Channel \"pear.nexista.org\" succeeded\n\nDiscovery of channel \"pear.nexista.org/pear/\" succeeded</pre>\n<p>I haven't fully tested this out, so I don't recommend using that channel. Once its reliable and setup correctly, I'll post instructions at <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">Nexista.org</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 2:</p>\n<p>I finally was able to install a PEAR package from my PEAR server. It appears that the PEAR server prefers having everything in the root directory. I was able to symlink the get and Chiara_PEAR_Server_REST folders to the root without much problem, though that's not how I'd like it setup.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/10/pear-channel-server/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PEAR Channel Server","date":"October 22nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/10/pear-channel-server/"}},
