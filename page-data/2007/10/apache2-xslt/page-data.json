Here's what I used in my config:</p>\n<pre class=\"xml\">    <Directory /var/www/public/xslt>        Order deny,allow        Deny from all        Allow from 192.168        SetOutputFilter mod-xslt        AddType text/xml .xml        XSLTSetStylesheet text/xml /var/www/public/test.xsl    </Directory></pre>\n<p>test.xml</p>\n<pre class=\"xml\"><?xml version=\"1.0\"?><top>    <a>blah</a></top></pre>\n<p>test.xsl</p>\n<pre class=\"xml\"><xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"><xsl:output method=\"html\" indent=\"yes\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" omit-xml-declaration=\"no\"\n\ndoctype-public=\"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\n\ndoctype-system=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\"/><xsl:template match=\"/\"><html><head>     <title>XSLT Test</title></head><body><div id=\"container\"><xsl:value-of select=\"//a\"/></div></body></html></xsl:template></xsl:stylesheet></pre>\n<p>In my test, Apache cached the XSL file even though a reboot and modification time change. Hmmm.</p>\n<p>Also, documents produced by modxslt generate this comment at the end of the document which is pretty cheesy:</p>\n<pre><!--  -* Generated by mod-xslt 1.3.9; http://www.mod-xslt2.com/  -* Copyright (C) 2002,2003 Carlo Contavalli - <ccontavalli at masobit.net>  -* derived from work by Philipp Dunkel and others (http://www.mod-xslt2.com/main/credits.xml)  -* Thanks to http://www.masobit.net/ for paying me while working on mod-xslt  -* and for providing resources to the project. --></pre>\n<p>That copyright message has no business being in a resulting document created by someone else. I'm surprised that Debian let something like that slip through. Blah.</p>\n<p>I was just sifting through the code and found this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mod-xslt2.com/doc/faq.xml?question=7&sect=1\">http://www.mod-xslt2.com/doc/faq.xml?question=7ยง=1</a></p>\n<p>That is even lamer that they are aware that people don't want it there but make it difficult to remove. Shame shame. At least its GPL so someone (me?) can fork it and remove that lameness.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2289622-10440259\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<p><img src=\"http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-2289622-10440259\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Once You Know, You Newegg\" border=\"0\"/></a></p>\n<p>After going through this, I frankly don't see the point of such a module anyway. If you are going to have XML and XSL docs transformed on the server, might as well render them to the desired static output. If you are going to do dynamic transformations based upon user input, why not use PHP? Apache isn't designed to handle complex logic, so if you pass that off to something like PHP, why not do the same with the transformations? Also, I think with javascript libs iike sarissa and goog-ajaxslt, offloading the transformations to client browsers will get much easier. For simple stuff, most modern browsers can do the XSL transformations themselves.</p>\n<p>In my humble opinion, it would make more sense to have Apache test for browser user agents, and pre-render the content when serving requests to older browsers.</p>\n<p>ยฅ</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/10/apache2-xslt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apache2 XSLT","date":"October 28th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/10/apache2-xslt/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
