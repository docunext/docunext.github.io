That's too bad, as command line php usage is gaining a lot of popularity.</p>\n<p>From what I've read, this may be due to licensing issues, which is also too bad.</p>\n<p>Why do I want PHP5 readline support? Mostly so that when using interactive php command line scripts, I can use the \"up arrow\" keystroke to recall my last command, as well as tab completion. Those are my favorite things about the command line and what make it such an efficient way to interact with computers.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I was able to compile and install readline as a module! That makes creating command line PHP applications much easier.</p>\n<pre>./configure --disable-cgi --enable-cli --with-readline=shared,/usr/include/readline/</pre>\n<p>Control file:</p>\n<pre>\nPackage: php5-readline\n\nVersion: 5.2.3\n\nSection: web\n\nPriority: optional\n\nArchitecture: i386\n\nDepends: php5-cli (>=5.2), libreadline5\n\nMaintainer: Albert Lash\n\nDescription: PHP 5 Readline Shared Object Helpful in the creation of interactive command line scripts written in PHP.</pre>\n<p>Package contents:</p>\n<pre>\nphp5-readline\n\nphp5-readline/etc\n\nphp5-readline/etc/php5\n\nphp5-readline/etc/php5/conf.d\n\nphp5-readline/etc/php5/conf.d/readline.ini\n\nphp5-readline/usr\n\nphp5-readline/usr/lib\n\nphp5-readline/usr/lib/php5\n\nphp5-readline/usr/lib/php5/20060613+lfs\n\nphp5-readline/usr/lib/php5/20060613+lfs/readline.so\n\nphp5-readline/DEBIAN\n\nphp5-readline/DEBIAN/control</pre>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/wp-content/sites/wwwdocunextcom/files/php5-readline_5.2.3.deb\">php5-readline_5.2.3.deb</a></p>\n<p>Note: The above debian package was created with my very limited experience!

So this package will not make it into the debian repositories.
