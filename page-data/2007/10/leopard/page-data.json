I stuck with Mail to leverage its integration with Spotlight, which was a waste because in my humble opinion, spotlight sucks.</li></ul>There are more, but that's it for now.","fields":{"slug":"/2007/10/leopard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Leopard","date":"October 24th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/10/leopard/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
