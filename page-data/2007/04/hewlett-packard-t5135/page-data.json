I couldn't get the bios up, but it booted off usb anyway. I started off the debian usb stick I have just to test, but then booted off a USB AstLinux stick. This is a nice machine for AstLinux, maybe even better than the WRAP or Soekris setups.</p>\n<a href='http://www-sa.evenserver.com/s/img/2007/04/snb10011.JPG' title='Debian Install on t5135 Copyright'>\n<img src='http://www-sa.evenserver.com/s/img/2007/04/snb10011.thumbnail.JPG' alt='Debian Install on t5135 Copyright' /></a>\n<p>With this arrival, I'm going to switch one of my WRAP devices back to m0n0wall for installation at our colocation facility.</p>\n<img src='http://www-sa.evenserver.com/s/img/2007/04/snb10010.thumbnail.JPG' alt='HP t5135 Copyright Docunext' />\n<p>(Those photographs were taken with a <a href=\"http://mytechdeals.blogspot.com/2007/04/eagerly-awaiting-samsung-nv7.html\">Samsung nv7</a> which I just bought.
