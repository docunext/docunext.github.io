These are the steps I took to install the program.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First I went to <a href=\"http://www.knoppmyth.net\">www.knoppmyth.net</a> and downloaded the iso.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then I burned the iso image to a disc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After I booted up the cd on the machine, I chose auto install.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then I had to edit the settings such as timezone, date, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It took around 20 minutes to install knoppmyth on the computer.  The installation process was pretty straightforward, as there weren't any areas I had trouble handling.</p>\n<h3>ID \"c7\" was respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes Error</h3>\n<p>Although, after I rebooted the computer, it said:</p>\n<pre>ID \"c7\" was respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes</pre>\n<p>I discovered that all you need to do to bypass this message is press enter.  Then it brings you to the root prompt. This error is preceded by the screen flashing a few times as the xserver is trying to start.</p>\n<p>The KnoppMyth <a href=\"http://www.knoppmyth.net/pamphlet.html\">Pamphlet</a> says the x11 should have started after the auto install, but for some reason it didn't.  Not sure why.  After that we tried a new graphics card (ATI XL/8M PCI), however upon rebooting we ran into the same problem.  The following message was displayed when we tried to manually \"startx\":</p>\n<pre>fatal server error: no screens found</pre>\n<p>We are attempting to get KnoppMyth to display a GUI (graphical user interface), which tells us that the program is running properly.  Now we are trying to update the installation to solve the problem.  <ol><li>Step one, installed xdebconfigurator (didn't work).</li><li>Step two, installed xvfb (didn't work).</li><li>Step Three xfce4 (still nothing).</li><li>Step four installed xserver-xorg</li><li>Step five was an apt-get upgrade for the entire distro</li></ol></p>\n<p>One thing we noticed was that the debian.geole.info source in /etc/apt/sources.list wasn't responding, so we commented it out. After the upgrade, we ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and  then startx, and xfce4 appeared! :-)</p>\n<p>Now comes the mythtv-setup process. We started this with the command:</p>\n<pre>mythtv-setup</pre>\n<h3>Hardware Setup</h3>\n<p>The following is an overview of the hardware we used to build our mythtv settopbox:</p>\n<ul><li>Video card: ATI XL/8M PCI</li><li>TV Tuner Card:</li><li>Processor: </li><li>Mainboard:</li></ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/04/knoppmyth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Knoppmyth","date":"April 26th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/04/knoppmyth/"}},
