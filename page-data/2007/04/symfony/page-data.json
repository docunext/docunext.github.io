I actually didn't need to install both the sandbox and the pear library, but I did anyway. It appears that the sandbox download includes all the libraries.</p>\n<p>The next steps were just as easy, though I had to install sqlite for php5. On debian, this was done:</p>\n<pre>apt-get install php5-sqlite</pre>\n<p>And then I added these to the /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file:</p>\n<pre>extension=php_pdo.so\n\nextension=php_sqlite.so </pre>\n<p>but that's gotta be wrong, because I'm getting this:</p>\n<p>I confirmed that pdo was loaded with:</p>\n<pre><?php\n\nphpinfo();?></pre>\n<p>in a temp.php file, and yes it is:</p>\n<p>So I tried rebuilding the symfony propel stuff from the command line, and it worked! I can see why they use sqlite for the initial module, its nice and easy to get going.</p>\n<p>Great work Fabien, and thanks again to Joshua for introducing me to symfony (and a bunch of other awesome php / linux stuff, like Gentoo!)</p>\n<p>Based upon this very positive experience, I may just try to somehow merge what I like about nexista with what I find helpful about symfony. I've created ALOT of applications with nexista, so I won't ditch nexista any time soon. To review, my favorite things about nexista are:</p>\n<ul><li>Separation of code, database I/O, and presentation</li><li>Speed</li><li>Use of widespread open standards like XSL and XML</li><li>Role based authentication</li><li>Minimalist design - Joshua did a great job of limiting the scope of nexista</li></ul>\n<p>Things I like about symfony so far:</p>\n<ul><li>There is book</li><li>Large user community</li><li>Internationalization support</li><li>Caching</li><li>Well organized</li><li>Nice DB IO</li></ul>\n<p>Things I don't like about symfony:</p>\n<ul><li>Yaml - I'm sure its fine, but xml is just so basic it can't be beat imho</li><li>No xsl support that I've seen yet</li></ul>\n<p>In my mind, I'm pretty pumped up about wordpress (and bbpress), nexista, mediawiki, and symfony these days. Something will probably come of excitement!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/04/symfony/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Symfony","date":"April 13th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/04/symfony/"}},
