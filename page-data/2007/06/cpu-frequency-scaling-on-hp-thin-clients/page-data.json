I can use the longhaul cpufreq driver without a hitch on my t5000 as it uses the VIA C3 chip, but I can't get anything to work on my t5135, as is uses the newer VIA Ester C7 Eden chip.</p>\n<p>I've done a bunch of research and some have said it might be available in 2.6.21, but its not there yet. The most promising candidates are longhaul and e_powersaver. I'm just looking to keep the temperature down when possible.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/cpu-frequency-scaling-on-hp-thin-clients/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CPU Frequency Scaling on HP Thin Clients","date":"June 7th, 2007","tags":"acpi,c7,energy,hp,power,via"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/cpu-frequency-scaling-on-hp-thin-clients/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
