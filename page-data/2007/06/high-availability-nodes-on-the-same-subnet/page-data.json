You might be able to run it on either machine, but I've only run it on the primary. Actually this time I had to run it on the secondary machine too.</p>\n<p>I will likely use an isolated crossover cable for future heartbeat installations.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/high-availability-nodes-on-the-same-subnet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"High Availability Nodes on the Same Subnet","date":"June 11th, 2007","tags":"drbd,\"high availability\""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/high-availability-nodes-on-the-same-subnet/"}}}
