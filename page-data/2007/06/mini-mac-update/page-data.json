I keep running into the same problem. I follow the instructions hold down the \"T\" key while you restart to connect the machines via firewire, but the old machine just shuts down when I do this.</p>\n<p>In searching for answers I found the following info on the mac website:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\nMake sure the target computer has an ATA hard drive on ATA bus 0. It is normal for a target computer to shut down if it does not detect an ATA hard drive on ATA bus 0.\n</pre></blockquote>\n<p>Gonna have to open up the old machine to make this work. I'll report the results shortly.</p>\n<p>Well we opened up the machine. Al had to use jumpers to make it work, but it did work.</p>\n<p>Took about 45 minutes to transfer all the data between the two machines, but now I'm operating on the mini, just like there was no transition.</p>\n<p>Thus far the only really noticeable difference in performance is that the mini is silent.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/mini-mac-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac Mini Migration Assistant","date":"June 15th, 2007","tags":"Apple,macmini"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/mini-mac-update/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
