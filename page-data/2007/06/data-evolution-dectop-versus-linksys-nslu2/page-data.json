They\nboth feature ethernet connectivity and low power consumption, and are similarly\npriced. However, the two are fairly different.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>dectop</strong></td><td><strong>NSLU2</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>x86 compatible AMD Geode 366Mhz</td><td>ARM 166 MGhz</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Cache</td><td>32 KB</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>128MB</td><td>32MB</td></tr><tr><td>Network</td><td>USB 1.1 Ethernet dongle</td><td>10/100 on-board LAN, plus USB 2.0 ethernet dongles</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>VGA support</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Power consumption</td><td>10 Watts*</td><td>5 / 15 Watts*</td></tr><tr><td>Bonus features</td><td>Internal hard drive</td><td>USB 2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Extra HW</td><td>Keyboard, mouse, USB ethernet, usb cable, built-in modem</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td>$99 + s/h</td><td>$75-$100</td></tr><tr><td>Availability</td><td>Now, future unknown</td><td>Available</td></tr></table>\n<h3>Operating System Considerations</h3>\n<h4><strong>Linksys NSLU2</strong></h4>\n<p>Installing debian on the NSLU2 can be tricky because it is headless, but it is\na well documented process. The NSLU2 comes with an operating system installed,\nand is useful out of the box. It also supports OpenSLUG and Unslung.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dectop</strong></h4>\n<p>The dectop ships with no operating system and one must be installed, raising the\ninitial price tag substantially due to the cost of labor. However, if the end\nuser is going to be doing the installation, the labor can be considered\nnegligible, as the installation could be part of its actual \"usage\". The dectop\nshould support any type of linux, bsd, or open source software installation\nincluding FreeDos, and should also support Windows CE with a new license.</p>\n<h4><strong>Overall Conclusions</strong></h4>\n<p>Both of these machines are amazing devices, and I'm glad I got a chance to work\nwith them both. As similar as they are, the subtle differences make them poised\nfor entirely different applications. The Linksys is very limited in its\ncapacity, but its very good at what it does. It provides network access to USB\ndevices, and that's it. It can do more, but in my humble opinion its not\nreally worth it.</p>\n<p>The dectop is a much more versatile and capable machine. Its really too bad that\nthey didn't provide on-board lan or linux pre-installed. Those two factors\naren't deal killers, but we'll need to see whether it is possible to install\na new operating system to the included hard-drive without opening up the box. My\nefforts were thwarted, but others have reported success.  Another possibility is\nto boot the dectop over a network, but we have yet to see if that is\na possibility. The one thing the dectop device does very well is provide\na low-power \"window to the internet\". Since most internet connections are\n5 Mbits or slower, the usb 1.1 ethernet dongle does not pose too big a limiting\nfactor in evaluating the performance. However, that limit makes an impact when\nconsidering this device as a local area network storage device. Compared to the\nslug, this thing would be a snail. That metaphor doesn't really work! In other\nwords, it would be really really slow. :-)</p>\n<p>It would be interesting to also compare a thin client to the dectop. HP makes\nsome very capable, low-power thin clients that also provide a \"window to the\ninternet\". Their limiting factor is the no-hard-drive aspect, but with\nsolid-state drives and USB flash drives getting bigger and bigger, that's\nbecoming less of an issue. They are more expensive, but go on sale from time to\ntime. <div style=\"background: #EEEEEE\">* Power measured with a Kill-a-watt\ndevice. dectop has a WD 80GB drive, NSLU2 has only a USB flash drive at 5W, an\nexternal 250GB drive at 15W.</div></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/data-evolution-dectop-versus-linksys-nslu2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Evolution decTop versus Linksys NSLU2","date":"June 23rd, 2007","tags":"debian,dectop,energy,nslu2,slug"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/data-evolution-dectop-versus-linksys-nslu2/"}}}
