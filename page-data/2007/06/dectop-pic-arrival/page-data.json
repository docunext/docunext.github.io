And its USB 1.0! :-(</p>\n<p>That pretty much ruins the whole thing for me, but it does come with enough schwag to make it not a total loss.</p>\n<p>Here's a quick picture of the guts:</p>\n<p>I'm installing debian to the locked drive right now. Not sure what locked drive means, but it hasn't hit me yet. When I try to reboot it will probably say \"sorry, you can't boot this operating system!\"</p>\n<p>Seems like the entire device was really tied to Microsoft. There are so many stickers and notices about how the product is licensed and produced for use is such and such a way. Weirdness.</p>\n<p>I only installed the base system and it took about 30-45 minutes.</p>\n<p>This is what happens with a locked disk:</p>\n<p>So I popped in a 80GB EIDE drive I had nearby. The fact that Seagate and AMD locked a drive is very disappointing to me, and I'm glad I've been using Western Digital drives and Intel chips more often these days.</p>\n<p>Finally got debian installed, and now for the good stuff!</p>\n<pre>\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\nprocessor       : 0\nvendor_id       : Geode by NSC\ncpu family      : 5\nmodel           : 5\nmodel name      : Geode(TM) Integrated Processor by National Semi\nstepping        : 2\ncpu MHz         : 365.243\ncache size      : 32 KB\nfdiv_bug        : no\nhlt_bug         : no\nf00f_bug        : no\ncoma_bug        : no\nfpu             : yes\nfpu_exception   : yes\ncpuid level     : 1\nwp              : yes\nflags           : fpu de pse tsc msr cx8 pge cmov mmx mmxext 3dnowext 3dnow\nbogomips        : 731.79</pre>\n<p>Network dongle:</p>\n<pre>drivers/usb/net/rtl8150.c: eth0: allmulti set\ndrivers/usb/net/rtl8150.c: eth0: allmulti set</pre>\n<p>Various dmesg output:</p>\n<pre>107MB LOWMEM available.\nOn node 0 totalpages: 27619  DMA zone: 4096 pages, LIFO batch:0  Normal zone: 23523 pages, LIFO batch:3</pre>\n<p>Processor:</p>\n<pre>CPU: NSC Geode(TM) Integrated Processor by National Semi stepping 02</pre>\n<p>And the absolute best thing about the dectop:</p>\n<p>The decTop only uses 9 Watts of power with an 80GB hard drive. :-)</p>\n<p>The sad truth:</p>\n<pre>iperf -c 192.168.0.2------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to 192.168.0.2, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)------------------------------------------------------------[  3] local 192.168.0.189 port 4055 connected with 192.168.0.2 port 5001[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  4.38 MBytes  3.67 Mbits/sec</pre>\n<p>Compare that to an Everex Stepnote NC1502 running Ubuntu:</p>\n<pre>iperf -c 192.168.0.2------------------------------------------------------------\nClient connecting to 192.168.0.2, TCP port 5001\nTCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)------------------------------------------------------------[  3] local 192.168.0.186 port 59190 connected with 192.168.0.2 port 5001[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec    102 MBytes  85.7 Mbits/sec</pre>\n<p>The Everex costs four times as much, but has much better resale value.
