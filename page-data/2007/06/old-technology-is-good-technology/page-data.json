The Ultra ATA 100 IDE hard disk drive interface. VGA. Fast Ethernet 10/100. Floppy disks. CD-ROMs. 32 bits.</p>\n<p>What do all these things have in common? They are old, outdated technology. But that's why I love 'em.</p>\n<p>In technology, especially open source technology, things need to be testing under an incredibly wide range of circumstances. If a particular type of technology is around long enough to be tried and tested by the open source community and survive, then chances are its good stuff. In many ways, survival of the \"open source\" test is a really impressive feat.</p>\n<p>While the above mentioned technologies might not be the fastest or most exciting new gadgets, but they work. They work reliably well in open source systems, which when configured correctly, can provide a reliable enough environment to experiment with other, cutting edge technology that may break from time to time. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/old-technology-is-good-technology/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Old Technology is Good Technology","date":"June 4th, 2007","tags":"hardware,\"open source\""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/old-technology-is-good-technology/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
