Since it runs gentoo, the upgrades can sometimes get a little hairy. Postfix was updated from 2.2.x to 2.3.x:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">* You are upgrading from a incompatible version.\n* You MUST stop postfix BEFORE install it to your system.\n* If you want a minimal downtime, emerge postfix with:\n* `FORCE_UPGRADE=1 emerge --buildpkgonly postfix`; then\n* `/etc/init.d/postfix stop && emerge --usepkgonly postfix`\n* run etc-update or dispatch-conf and merge the configuration files.\n* Next /etc/init.d/postfix start</pre>\n<p>I searched for other experiences and everyone seemed to have an okay time upgrading, so I did too, and it worked fine. Now we get to use the \"sleep\" function in main.cf. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/postfix-update-on-gentoo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Postfix Update on Gentoo","date":"June 13th, 2007","tags":"email clients,spam"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/postfix-update-on-gentoo/"}},
