Still, these look to be solid technologies that will be around for awhile, so I've decided to get started with them now.</p>\n<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>\n<p>I had incorrectly upgraded them with the <strong>7045.bin</strong> file, which caused the system to freeze upon the Sil 3132 bios post. I re-flashed the cards with the <strong>r7045.bin</strong> file and now it posts fine and continues booting. :-)</p>\n<p>These are really great cards for the price. <strong>With a few minutes during the debian install you can build a really sweet raid5 system.</strong> Very nice indeed.</p>\n<p>FYI: I think these cards use either the sata_sil24 or siimage kernel modules, which are commonly available on linux.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/06/sil-3132-pci-express-sata-ii-cards/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sil 3132 PCI Express SATA II Cards","date":"June 12th, 2007","tags":"debian,firmware,sata,storage,troubleshooting"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/06/sil-3132-pci-express-sata-ii-cards/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
