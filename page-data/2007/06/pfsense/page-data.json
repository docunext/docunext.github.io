I just tried the VMWare virtual machine for it and was very impressed. I think I'll stick to m0n0wall for the front lines, but then use pfsense for behind the scenes routing and load balancing.</p>\n<p>I doubt I'll continue to use VMWare, but it is convenient right now. I'd like to be able to understand the networking stack used with QEMU and the vde. Just did a quick search and this turned up:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:vde\"><a href=\"http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:vde\">http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:vde</a></a></p>\n<p>Looks to be exactly what I'm looking for!
