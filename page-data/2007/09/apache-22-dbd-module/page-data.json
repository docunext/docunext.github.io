My notes are a mess but they may be of use to you, I'm sure they'll be useful to me pretty soon!</p>\n<p>What's this new module all about? It provides access to SQL databases. What's the big deal with that? Well it will provide much better resource management, meaning a more efficient web server. <strong>It will also provide the ability to tie easily managed  authentication to your apache web server</strong>. This is a good thing TM. Most people don't want to have to manage dbm hash and or htpasswd files all over the place, so they use a rdbms to store their user's credentials which would usually require a scripting language module or cgi program to access. There are a couple of problems with that, if there is an error in the scripting language or a configuration change on the server, a malfunction could cause a security breach, and it also uses system resources inefficiently. Most of the time this is not a big deal, but since the practice of authenticating web users has become so commonplace, its nice to know that this optimized module can be used very soon.</p>\n<p>Unless you wanted to fiddle with javascript or use SSL, you'd be sending your credentials in cleartext over the internet, which isn't any fun. The new module <strong>mod_dbd can even use digest authentication</strong>, which isn't perfect, but is way better than cleartext.</p>\n<p>My guess is that we'll also see this module getting used with mod_rewrite to provide the ability to store rewrite rules in a database. Wouldn't that be awesome! While it's possible to do today using the prg: hook, its not the best solution.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to see mod_dbd empower apache to log directly to a sql database. That would be magnificent!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/new-dbd-drivers/\"><a href=\"http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/new-dbd-drivers/\">http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/new-dbd-drivers/</a></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apache2.html\"><a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apache2.html\">http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apache2.html</a></a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/09/apache-22-dbd-module/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apache 2.2 DBD Module","date":"September 11th, 2007","tags":"apache,ssl"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/09/apache-22-dbd-module/"}},
