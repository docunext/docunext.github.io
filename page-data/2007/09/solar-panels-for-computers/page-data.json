My setup consists of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>solar panel</li>\n<li>charge controller</li>\n<li>battery pack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was using the charge controller with the battery pack input, but then I noticed the charge controller seriously limits the output - I think its designed for more than one solar panel of the size that I have. It was reducing the output from .25 amps to .005 amps. So no wonder it wasn't charging!</p>\n<p>The input I'm using on the battery pack has a charge controller of its own, so I'm comfortable going directly from the panel to the battery.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/09/solar-panels-for-computers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Solar Panels for Computers","date":"September 2nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/09/solar-panels-for-computers/"}},
