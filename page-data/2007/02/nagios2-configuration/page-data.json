The use of templates makes it much easier. Ony thing that irks me so far is that for http virtual hosts, you need a host entry and a service entry, as you can't use the address setting in the services.cfg file. Right now I'm checking if a host can be checked without a service entry. Seems logical enough. Ah I see, you can use the same services.cfg entry for multiple hosts in the hosts.cfg file, listing them out separated by commas. Perfect.</p>\n<p>I just found the nagios page that talks about this exact setup:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/1_0/templatetricks.html\">Nagios 2: Time-Saving Tricks For Template-Based Object Definitions</a></p>\n<p>Also called: \"How To Preserve Your Sanity\"!</p>\n<p>The beauty of this is that to create new checks for additional websites I put up, all I have to do is update the hosts file with two pieces of info: the name of the host and the address to use. For example;</p>\n<pre>host_name       example.com\n\naddress     www.example.com</pre>\n<p>Wow, even cooler is the fact that you can use regexp with the wildcard option!</p>\n<p>So here's how I have my virtual host www's setup for checking in nagios2. This way, the dns and the webserver will be checked to some extent.</p>\n<p><strong>hosts.cfg</strong></p>\n<pre>define host{        use                     virtual-host        host_name               example.com        address                 www.example.com}</pre>\n<p><strong>hostgroups.cfg</strong></p>\n<pre>define hostgroup{        hostgroup_name  vhost-production-machines        alias           vhost        members         .*com}</pre>\n<p>For my purposes, all I need for semi-automated nagios configuration files is a simple template I can make in PHP. If you are considering one of the many web based nagios management tools, I note that for me, it was easier to get the configuration files in place first, then write up a small script to serve my needs.</p>\n<p>Sidenote: <strong>Similarities between configuration of fail2ban and nagios2</strong></p>\n<p>I like what I'm seeing here. There are some definitely similaries between the structure of the configuration files for fail2ban and nagios2.
