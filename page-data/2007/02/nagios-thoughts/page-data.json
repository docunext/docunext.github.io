Yup, it worked!</p>\n<p>Now onto more concepts:</p>\n<p><strong>hosts.cfg or services.cfg</strong></p>\n<p>I think that an organization setting up nagios will edit all the files to begin with, and then once its up and running, they would only need to edit hosts from time to time as they add / remove machines. However, it seems that services is just as involved. I would think that for each host you could specify a set of services, but it seems to be the other way around. In services.cfg, you specify the host that a service is hosted upon.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/nagios-thoughts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nagios Thoughts","date":"February 4th, 2007","tags":"open source"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/02/nagios-thoughts/"}},
