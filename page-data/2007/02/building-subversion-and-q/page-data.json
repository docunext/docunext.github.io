The tips on making Windows 2000 and XP faster actually worked really well.</p>\n<p>How do you like that the build instructions actually work! The svn site for Transmission rejected my requests, so I downloaded the current sources from the <a href=\"http://transmission.m0k.org/\">Transmission homepage</a>.</p>\n<p>It might be fun to tweak some optimization flags for building Q, but I should probably go to sleep instead! The 0.9.0 build of Q does feel zippier though. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/building-subversion-and-q/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building subversion and Q","date":"February 19th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/02/building-subversion-and-q/"}},
