I understand they didn't want to go with mbox because of Spotlight, and because mbox just puts all the emails into one huge file. Not good for me with so many emails.</p>\n<p>I like the idea of keeping my emails in maildir format for archival purposes. Simple, straightforward, and manageable. However, with the lack of IMAP subs in Mail.app, it makes my connection a bit much. On top of that, I syncronize my home directory between my notebooks, desktops, and server environments so it makes sense to leverage the existing maildir storage hierarchy instead of having another storage mechanism I have to work around.</p>\n<p>I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Evolution on Mac OS X will actually be a decent email client solution, AND be able to read local maildir folders. Argh, I think Ximian Evolution requires Gnome so I'm going to skip the 650MB+ installation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fivepoundsflax.blogspot.com/2006/09/imap-idle-103-for-apples-mailapp.html\">IDLE Plugin for Mail.app</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.npcole.com/usingimaptiger.html\">Local IMAP Server to serve maildir archives to Mail.app</a> &#x3C;- This is probably what I'm going to go with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://software.complete.org/offlineimap/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions\">OfflineIMAP</a> This looks very cool too.

Hmm, maybe I could do something tricky, yet reliable with the network settings or something.</p>\n<p>The IMAP Proxies I've looked at don't seem to cache emails into a maildir at the local level, so it would have to be done with a full fledged imap server.
