After doing a little surfing on these subjects, I was surprised to find how much power processors consume, compared to say a hard drive.</p>\n<p>From what I understand, a drive will consume anywhere from 20-60 watts, while a processor can eat up to 100 watts. Wowzer.</p>\n<p>A 3Ware card only consumes about 10 watts, which is awesome.</p>\n<p>So a couple of questions I'd like to find answers to: * Do dual-core processors add twice as much \"processing power\" with a marginal increase in \"electrical power\" requirements?* How much processing is really required for super fast raid1 and / or raid5?</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/storage/hddpower.html\">Hard drive power consumption</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_power_dissipation\">CPU power dissipation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hardwareinreview.com/cms/content/view/29/29/\">Dual Core Processing</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/designing-the-low-power-pc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Designing the low power PC","date":"February 24th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/02/designing-the-low-power-pc/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
