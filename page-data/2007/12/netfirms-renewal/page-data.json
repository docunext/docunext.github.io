They requested I either send my account information (maybe they should add some options on their control panel to cancel?) or email them the welcome email they sent me when I opened the account. Luckily I still had it, so I emailed that to them.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/netfirms-renewal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NetFirms Renewal But I already canceled","date":"December 9th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/12/netfirms-renewal/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
