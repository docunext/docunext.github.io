I tend to agree, as I believe there is room for an ultra mobile pc (UPMC) and Apple would be the best to fill it, for now. I have a nokia 800 and I love it. I don't use it nearly as much as my laptop, because its too small for general use. When I need something small, its perfect. There are many times when a laptop is just a tiny bit too big, but I don't need pocket size. Maybe something like the Amazon Kindle would be good. I'm still hoping they can figure out some way to reduce the heat of laptops and extend their battery life. I don't need super performance, just the web, email and the command line. The eeepc looks good, but its pricey at $400.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/mac-tablet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac Tablet","date":"December 9th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/12/mac-tablet/"}},
