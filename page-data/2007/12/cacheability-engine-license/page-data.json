I noticed you restrict the software from modification, however I had to patch it to make it work with more current versions of python. Would you please reconsider releasing this software under the GPL or Affero GPL?\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully he'll go for it. :-) If not, that would be a downer, because it's a great piece of software which could help improve website performance.</p>\n<p>Oh well, his mail server (pobox.com) just rejected my email, even though I have a reverse IP A record on a static IP, an SPF record permitting the IP to send mail at my domain, and am not block listed anywhere. Too bad.</p>\n<p>This is how the software is licensed:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThis software may be freely distributed, but may not be modified in any way.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lame?
