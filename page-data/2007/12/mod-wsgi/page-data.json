Its terrific to have choices. :-)</p>\n<p>I also posted this comment to clw, it doesn't seem to have gone through:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>England has those nice ocean cliffs too - made it a very hard place to invade prior to aircraft.</p>\n<p>mod_wsgi looks great. I agree - running web apps as daemons via a server like apache is terrific. Currently I use mod_fcgid and it works good with psyco. Python is indeed good stuff, so far I've used fail2ban, cacheability engine,  and trac, but that's about it. Some of it still seems a little weird, but its growing on me. I guess PEAR is just as weird as egg. Cool post about the apt python tool for debian too - thanks for that. </blockquote></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/mod-wsgi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"mod wsgi","date":"December 8th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/12/mod-wsgi/"}},
