In this case, I wanted to install to a separate directory, so I followed these directions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#administrator-installation\">http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#administrator-installation</a></p>\n<p>And also updated my PYTHONPATH environment variable, but I'm sure if I had to. Unfortunately, I jumped the gun and installed it to my debian base prior to doing the custom install. I've heard that easy_install and debian don't get along terribly well, which is really too bad, as I'm obviously a huge fan of debian, and at the same time enjoying python more and more.</p>\n<p>To sum up some other notes about how I use trac, I set it up with Apache 2.2, mod_fcgid, and VirtualScriptAlias. Although its not totally automagic, its pretty darn close, and runs very well. I finally am now able to use <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/11/trac-with-mysql/\">trac with mysql</a>, and that is really awesome too.</p>\n<p>UPDATE December 5, 2007: The file required to have a different python location is: altinstall.pth in the site-packages folder.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/more-fun-with-trac/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"More fun with trac","date":"December 2nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/12/more-fun-with-trac/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
