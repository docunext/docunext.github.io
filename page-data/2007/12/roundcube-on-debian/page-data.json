I first used roundcube thanks to the fine folks at <a href=\"http://thirteen.net/\">thirteen</a>, and have previously tried it on a manual install. Both times it worked fine, but I continue to use squirrelmail for its reliability.</p>\n<p>Now that roundcube is in debian, I'm leaning towards using that instead. I also noticed it can use sqlite as the backend, which makes it a super easy setup. I'll probably opt for mysql so that the web-based side of the email service can be made more distributed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/roundcube-on-debian/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roundcube on Debian","date":"December 8th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/12/roundcube-on-debian/"}},
