Actually, doing a little more research, I am recalling some issues I had with the e1000 driver a little over a year ago. I did some research and found that there were some definite issues with the intel driver. Hopefully they've since been fixed, but its important to note.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/gigeth32bit/gig-eth-32bit-2.html\">http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/gigeth32bit/gig-eth-32bit-2.html</a></p>\n<p>Intel has a great reputation for their cards though, and the issue I had was actually related more to the switch than the intel card. Other than Intel, I've had good luck with Broadcom chips, which are prevalent in SMC products.</p>\n<p>If I were to choose a card today, it would be the <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/pro1000mt_dual_server_adapter.htm\">PWLA8492MT</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/gigeth32bit/index.html\">http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/gigeth32bit/index.html</a></p>\n<p>Other alternatives are to not use a gigabit card, but a fast ethernet (100mbit) card. There are plenty of these that will provide very good performance within linux:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hpc.sfu.ca/bugaboo/nic-test.html\">http://www.hpc.sfu.ca/bugaboo/nic-test.html</a></p>\n<p>This shows what a great nic card 3com made. I say \"made\" because they discontinued the 3c900 series. :-(</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Howto/Ethernet-HOWTO-4.html\">http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Howto/Ethernet-HOWTO-4.html</a></p>\n<p>I think I will get one Intel dual port card for a server, and some 3com 10/100 cards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833114004\">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833114004</a> - check this out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reviewed By: softweyr on 2/27/2007 Reviewed By: softweyr on 2/27/2007 Rating + 3Rating + 3Rating + 3</p>\n<p>Tech Level Tech Level: high - Ownership: less than 1 day</p>\n<p>Pros: Cheap</p>\n<p>Cons: Cheap</p>\n<p>Other Thoughts: Tait - the limited throughput you saw was not caused by the CPUs, your system and this card are limited by the bandwidth of the PCI bus.
