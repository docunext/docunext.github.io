Grrr.</p>\n<pre>racoon ERROR: give up to get IPsec-SA due to time up to wait</pre>\n<p>For me, this was a subnet misconfiguration. I had 192.168.0.1/24 instead of 192.168.0.0/24. Could have been some other glitchy things I was screwing around with, but the beautiful thing is that it works!</p>\n<p>Connecting two separate LANs over a VPN is super cool. I'm really liking it, and have plans to do a whole lot more. I can see how useful this type of setup can be. This will fit very nicely into the modularization efforts I'm working on.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/m0n0wall-vpn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"m0n0wall VPN","date":"March 12th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/03/m0n0wall-vpn/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
