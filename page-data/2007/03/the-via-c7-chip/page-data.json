Amazing. Anyway, I just picked up a couple of PC Chips motherboards which come with the 1.5 Ghz VIA C7 soldered on.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the ASUS Terminator which comes with a VIA C3 consumes around 33 watts with only a compact flash card in it - no drives at all (not ever a CD-ROM). I was hoping it would get less.</p>\n<p>The AMD Geode Mini-itx board I bought fared even worse! Without anything hooked up besides a processor, processor fan, and a stick of memory, the board consumed 45 watts. That was with an Antec as well as a SeaSonic power supply. I'm sure I could reduce it from there with some power throttling, but still, I was hoping it would be lower.</p>\n<p>I've heard reports that the MSI Axis Lite which comes with a C7 only consumes about 15 watts of power. Much better!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/the-via-c7-chip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Via C7 Chip","date":"March 10th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/03/the-via-c7-chip/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
