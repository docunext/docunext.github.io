Not only have many of their servers been unreachable over the past several days, but they also have removed my posts from their status blog. Not cool!</p>\n<p>Once I get all my files off their servers, I'm cancelling my account.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: In response to my last email to Dreamhost.com, they moved my services to another server, which has been much more reliable. Don't know why they didn't do that in the first place, but oh well.
