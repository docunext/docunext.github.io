The migration processis going smoothly so far! It will be interesting to see if any apps go ape moving from PowerPC to x86. Ran into an issue where the migration assistant won't transfer an account with the same shortname as on that already exists on the target. Argh. So I setup an interim account to be deleted later, deleted the offending account, and am trying again. Looks good so far, though its telling me its going to take 13 hours to transfer, hope not!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/mac-os-x-migration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mac OS X Migration","date":"March 12th, 2007","tags":"Apple"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/03/mac-os-x-migration/"}},
