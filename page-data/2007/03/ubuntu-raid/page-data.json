Now trying Suse - still crashed.

Now this is something I'm familiar with - pretty much just like a Debian text install. The first time I tried making the /boot partition a raid device but that was a no go. So I made it a regulat ext2 partition and it worked fine. Upon reboot it looked great - honestly Ubuntu 6.10 is a thing of beauty.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/ubuntu-raid/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu Software RAID0","date":"March 2nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/03/ubuntu-raid/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
