I think I'll be able to run it on a remote machine without a problem, but to view the test in progress, I believe I'll need VNC or No Machine's FreeNX to connect to an X server. That is something I've wanted to setup anyway, so I'll get to it. I've got the perfect machine to set this up on: an <a title=\"Cheap laptop\" href=\"http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/23/recommended-notebook-everex-stepnote-nc1503/\">Everex NC1503 running linux</a>!</p>\n<p>Actually, I'm ending up using the <a href=\"http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/01/350-laptop-arrived/\">$350 laptop</a> I purchased from Fry's awhile back, it's less energy efficient than the Everex, but it will only be on while I'm conducting tests. For this to work, I'm setting up a VNC server on the laptop. Its already running Ubuntu, and I'm following these instructions:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=122402\">HOWTO: Set up VNC server with resumable sessions</a></p>\n<p>Actually that howto is really old, this one is better for Ubuntu 7:\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2007/02/16/howto-remote-desktop-with-vnc-in-ubuntu-edgy-gnu-linux/\">HOWTO: Set up VNC server with resumable sessions</a></p>\n<p>The laptop is currently updating a bunch of stuff, so I'm waiting for that to finish before installing VNC.</p>\n<p>Got VNC up and running, now I'm upgrading Java (Selenium RC requires Java 1.5 or greater).</p>\n<pre><code>java -version\njava version \"1.5.0_11\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode, sharing)</code></pre>\n<p>All set!</p>\n<p>I've run into this issue several times: when I try and start a new browser session, I get \"<a href=\"http://forums.openqa.org/message.jspa?messageID=16541\">Preparing Firefox profile...</a>\" then it hangs there. This has happened on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. Hmmmm, maybe this is caused by a firefox that crashed? Nope, I guess that's caused by a Firefox 2.0 thing, so I'm going to use the latest version of Selenium RC.</p>\n<p>Now I'm installing PHP5, PEAR, and Apache2, as well as phpunit through pear. Done, that was easy!</p>\n<p>So, while I have testing environments set up for various application servers, this will be our first testing client machine. :-)</p>\n<h3>Benefits of driving Selenium RC with PHPUnit</h3>\nAs far as I can tell, the benefit for me to use PHPUnit with Selenium is that PHPUnit can output reports of the test results.\n<p>In addition to that, we can also build tests automatically, which is pretty sweet.</p>\n<p>I also just figured out how to set a test to use a remote selenium RC server:</p>\n<pre><code>void setHost(string $host)\t</code></pre>\n<p>\"Set the hostname for the connection to the Selenium RC server.\"</p>\n<p><b>Related Links</b></p>\n<p>Getting Selenium RC and PHPUnit to work together was a little vague, but I found these links helpful:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/631-Integrating-PHPUnit-with-Selenium.html\">sebastian-bergmann.de/...Integrating-PHPUnit-with-Selenium</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devzone.zend.com/article/2242-Acceptance-Testing-of-Web-Applications-with-PHP\">devzone.zend.com/...Acceptance-Testing-of-Web-Applications-with-PHP</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/3.1/en/selenium.html\">phpunit.de/...selenium.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/tutorial.html\">openqa.org/selenium-rc/tutorial.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PHPUnit Selenium RC","date":"August 13th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/phpunit-selenium-rc/"}}}
