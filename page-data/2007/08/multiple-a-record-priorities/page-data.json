However, SRV records aren't used by http clients (browsers) at the moment.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/multiple-a-record-priorities/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Multiple A Record Priorities","date":"August 30th, 2007","tags":"dns"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/multiple-a-record-priorities/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
