This one was thing I missed with PHP. Although its definitely command line capable, I wouldn't call PHP \"CLI-friendly\".</p>\n<p><strong>Active user community</strong> - seems like everyone and their <a href=\"http://www.healthybot.com/\">mom</a> is using ruby!</p>\n<p><strong>Good documentation</strong>. Nuff said.</p>\n<h3>What I don't like about Ruby: </h3>\n<p><strong>YAML</strong> - No! I won't buy into it! I'm sticking with XML!</p>\n<p><strong>Slow?</strong> - Am I doing something wrong? Ruby on Rails seems really slow to me. At first I thought it was webrick (see below), but now I'm running ruby with Apache2 and fastcgi (fcgid) and its still slow....</p>\n<p>I just got going with retrospectiva, a software focused ticketing system. It includes a wiki and a blog system, but I prefer Wordpress and MediaWiki for those functions. Thankfully, retrospectiva includes a method to remove those extensions! What I like about retrospectiva is the way it integrates a ticketing system with source code management, similar to Trac. Both of these systems thus have milestones to help track your progress. That in itself is pretty sweet.</p>\n<p>I ran into a glitch with retrospectiva because my subversion repository is an amalgamation of different external repositories. Retrospectiva can't access external repositories, so I created a new local one and it worked fine. Besides that, retrospectiva is kind of slow. It could be due to the fact that I was running it on the built in ruby webserver, \"webrick\". I'll try lighttpd next.</p>\n<p>I also got confused trying to find out how to control guest access to the projects. Finally found it under \"Groups -> Default\". Hope that helps! You can control what the users have access to.</p>\n<p>Urg - I'm still troubled by how slow my retrospectiva install is going. I'm trying out trac and its way faster. I think I might just go with trac. Trac is written in python and SQLite is recommended as a storage mechanism for it. So far I really like it. I was concerned that the wiki would be readily hackable, but you can make pages write only.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/what-i-like-and-dont-like-about-ruby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What I like and don t like about Ruby","date":"August 7th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/what-i-like-and-dont-like-about-ruby/"}}}
