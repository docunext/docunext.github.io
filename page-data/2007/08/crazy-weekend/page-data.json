One of my servers crashed, so when I rebooted it, I decided to upgrade the kernel, finally setup VLANs on the Cisco switch at the colo, and reconfigure the VPN there as well.</p>\n<p>That was a perfect combination of stuff to happen at once for me to learn a whole bunch about networking and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The colo is now setup well enough that I can start the process of setting it up better. I'm planning to use <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">OpenVZ</a>, load balancing, high-availability, and firewalls to their fullest potential, so that our infrastructure is more modular across the board.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I'd like to setup pfSense high-availability routers at the front, but that is a ways away. :-)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/crazy-weekend/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Crazy Weekend","date":"August 26th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/crazy-weekend/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
