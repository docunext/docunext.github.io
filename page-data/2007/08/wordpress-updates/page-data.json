A local database for reading, and a master which is hosted on another computer for inserts, updates, and deletes, as described above. It works AWESOME! So fast, highly distributed and available, and generally cool.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 2: For remote updates, I'd like to turn on compression. Apparently PHP is able to do so with the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/function.mysql-connect\">MYSQL<em>CLIENT</em>COMPRESS flag in the mysql_connect function</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 3: I'm getting a lot of problems with spam karma 2 and a multi-database setup. I'll have to either rework spam karma 2, rework the wordpress config files, or setup sql-relay.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 4 November 24, 2007: I finally got around to creating the trigger which flushes all the cached files when an ANY edit is made. I also am using a custom cache location, and need to make that configurable before sharing.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/wordpress-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wordpress Updates","date":"August 28th, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/wordpress-updates/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","758480095"]}
