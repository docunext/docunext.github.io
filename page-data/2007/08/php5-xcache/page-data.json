I had used it in the past a little, but then put it on the shelf for awhile because it seemed a little buggy. The developer has been hard at work and the project has come a long way since I last checked in. The developer also contributes to lighttpd, and I've also recently started to dabble with that again.</p>\n<p>But anyway back to XCache - it is an opcode cacher for PHP and helps speed up PHP scripts by caching their compiled versions, as PHP is an interpreted language - the compiling happens at runtime. It also has a variable cache, which seems to me to be a quick and easy memcache alternative. You can simply store variables in the cache, and retrieve them later. Pretty cool! I ran into a problem with this once by adding such mechanisms into my code, and then trying to run that code on machines that didn't have xcache installed. Doh!</p>\n<p>Inasmuch, the opcode cache works if xcache is available and activated with no changes to the source PHP code, which is nice for portability.</p>\n<p>When trying to install the XCache FreeBSD port, I ran into a problem:</p>\n<pre>Cannot find autoconf. Please check your autoconf installation and the $PHP_AUTOCONF\n\nenvironment variable is set correctly and then rerun this script. </pre>\n<p>I reinstalled php5 and autoconf but still got the error, so I logged out, and logged back in, and then it worked. Huh.<b>FreeBSD PHP5</b></p>\n<p>While on the subject, I'll mention how to enable php5 on freebsd / lighttpd:</p>\n<ul><li>Edit /usr/local/etc/lighttpd.conf uncomment \"mod_fastcgi\",</li><li>Enable XCache php5: copy xcache.ini /usr/local/etc/php/ (I had to create that folder)</li></ul>\n<p>I also noticed that the php cgi module has been hardened: \"This server is protected with the Suhosin Patch 0.9.6.2\".</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/php5-xcache/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PHP5 XCache","date":"August 1st, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/php5-xcache/"}}}
