Perl appears to be a great language, with so many libraries (or modules as they are called in perl) to work with.</p>\n<p>I'm a little embarrassed, but after all these years I'm still very much a novice with perl. I've used plenty of software written in it, but I've never actually had to write any. At one point I did edit a login script which was called by ejabberd, but I really didn't know what I was doing! :-)</p>\n<p>I'm such a newbie when it comes to perl that I'll have to look in the cookbook to find some stuff to learn about!</p>\n<p>One thing I have been wondering about is finding perl dependencies. I found ScanDep, which finds all the perl modules which a perl module depends on, and then someone on the perl.beginners usenet group told me about the <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/PAR-0.976/\">Perl Archive Toolkit</a>. There is a variation on the scandeps.pl function I tried before which output file dependencies as well as module dependencies:</p>\n<pre>scandeps.pl -V -e \"use DJabberd.pm\"</pre>\n<p>Previously I thought it would only output modules.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/perl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Perl","date":"August 22nd, 2007","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/perl/"}},
