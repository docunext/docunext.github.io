For expandability, it also has a PCI slot as well as a mini-pci slot, which many people use for wireless connectivity in both the WRAP boards and the Soekris boards.</p>\n<p>I've already pre-ordered an ALIX1c, and am eagerly waiting its shipment. I also plan to order some of the other boards to support our growing networks.</p>\n<p>The ALIX uses the VT6105M \"Via Rhine\" chipset. I'm interested to see how well it performs.</p>\n<h4><strong>ALIX versus DecTop</strong></h4>\n<p>The ALIX could be compared to the DecTop in some regards, each has some pros and cons. The ALIX has an on-board NIC, the dectop is cheaper and includes a hard drive. The ALIX is faster, the dectop has upgradeable RAM. The ALIX is RoHS, the dectop is not. The dectop includes a case, the ALIX is a common form factor - mini-itx. The ALIX also includes a mini-pci slot for wireless nixs.</p>\n<p>For surfing the web, the DecTop is a good choice in my opinion - it even includes a keyboard and mouse. If you are looking for a network appliance, the ALIX is a better choice.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/pc-engines-wrap-successor-alix/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PC Engines WRAP Successor ALIX","date":"July 2nd, 2007","tags":"alix,dectop,energy,\"pc engines\",wrap"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/pc-engines-wrap-successor-alix/"}}}
