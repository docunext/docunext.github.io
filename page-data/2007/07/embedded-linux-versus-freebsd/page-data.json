In fact, it might be an easier road for me because of the amount of various projects and documentation available - however messy and disorganized it may be!</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD embedded projects like m0n0wall are pretty amazing, but to get a shell and a web server on a device that costs around $50 with 4MB of flash rom and 16MB of RAM is outstanding.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, don't know how feasible it would be to install lighttpd (though only 71kb) on such a device. Also, looks like there is no ipkg for php, though it looks like the FreeWRT toolchain has the ability to build it into an image.</p>\n<p>Somewhat unrelated, I just found this decent thread about routers <a href=\"http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/469092836/m/241007975831\" title=\"decent thread about routers\">here</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/embedded-linux-versus-freebsd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Embedded Linux versus FreeBSD","date":"July 22nd, 2007","tags":"embedded"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/embedded-linux-versus-freebsd/"}},
