I think it has something to do with OpenGL versus Microsoft's \"Direct\" 3D rendering library, but I'm really not sure. I know there are some Wine-like tools which allow linux computers to play video games, but they are commercial programs. This is something I'm going to do more research on, and if anyone has any pointers, I'd appreciate it.</p>\n<p>This looks like a good lead:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linuxgames.com/?dataloc=articles/icculus/\"><a href=\"http://www.linuxgames.com/?dataloc=articles/icculus/\">http://www.linuxgames.com/?dataloc=articles/icculus/</a></a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/video-games-for-linux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Video Games for Linux","date":"July 12th, 2007","tags":"linux,microsoft,opengl"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/video-games-for-linux/"}},
