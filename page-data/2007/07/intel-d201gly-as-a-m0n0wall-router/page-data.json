It needs an extra nic card though. I just sent this to the m0n0wall list:</p>\n<blockquote>You all might want to consider the new intel d201gly mini-itx. Its less than $100, takes cheap ram, and has a pci slot for an extra nic.\n<p>Combine that with a mini-box m300 ($60), a stick of ram ($30), a compact flash card ($25), a power supply ($50), and the extra nic ($25) and you're in great shape for a couple hundred bucks.</p>\n<p>If energy consumption is a big deal, then this probably isn't the right machine for you, as it uses about 25 watts of power. </blockquote></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2007/06/intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board/\">More information about the intel d201gly</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/intel-d201gly-as-a-m0n0wall-router/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"intel d201gly as a m0n0wall router","date":"July 10th, 2007","tags":"d201gly,debian,intel,mini-itx,power,ram"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/intel-d201gly-as-a-m0n0wall-router/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
