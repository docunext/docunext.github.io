Its really good! Its my first book on Ruby and it is easy to read, and the author has a good sense of humor and an imaginative creative talent.</p>\n<p>Speaking of creative talent, my wife and I just watched <a href=\"http://www.neofilmz.com/blog/2007/06/howls-moving-castle.html\">Howl's Moving Castle</a>. A great animation with all sorts of cool artwork and story lines.</p>\n<p>But back to ruby, I like it as a programming language so far. It is straightforward and easy to implement. It might be an good language to learn before trying to tackle C or C++. One thing that interested me already is the standard libraries it has access to, like the ssh socket.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog\">http://www.docunext.com/blog</a><a href=\"/http://www.docunext.com/blog\">/http://www.docunext.com/blog</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/practical-ruby-for-system-administrators/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Practical Ruby for System Administrators","date":"July 28th, 2007","tags":"programming,ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/practical-ruby-for-system-administrators/"}}}
