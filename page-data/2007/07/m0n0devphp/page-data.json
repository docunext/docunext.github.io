I've use the smp build successfully, but when I try the generic pc the bootloader can't find the kernel. ls reveals there is a file there called kernel.gz. Is it supposed to be compressed? Maybe mine is corrupt. Rebuilding now...\n</pre></blockquote></p>\n<p>OK I just rebuilt everything and still no luck.
