Its too bad that the low end gets such low efficiency - less than 70% for around 40 Watts.</p>\n<p>Since my system doesn't need a lot of juice, I might end up switching the power supply.</p>\n<p>I have a SeaSonic S12 330, and it gets about the same level of efficiency.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/antec-su-380/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Antec SU 380","date":"July 3rd, 2007","tags":"acpi,energy,hardware"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/antec-su-380/"}}}
