Here's what I've been working:</p>\n<ul><li>512MB debian install - this is about the smallest usable debian install I've worked with. It is possible to go smaller but not really worth it. With a 24MB swap, 84MB boot partition, and the rest for root. I've been able to install ejabberd in it, and that alone makes it a very useful appliance.</li><li>1GB debian install - this is about as small as you can go with a debian gui. I've installed fluxbox on it and its working great!</li></ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/qemu-virtual-machines-appliances/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"QEMU virtual machines and appliances","date":"July 15th, 2007","tags":"debian,fluxbox,qemu"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/07/qemu-virtual-machines-appliances/"}}}
