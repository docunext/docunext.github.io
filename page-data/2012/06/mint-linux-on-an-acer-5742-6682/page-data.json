Its a bit ironic - having bought two of the same laptops (they were cheap) in an attempt to keep at least one of them up-and-running no matter what.</p>\n<p>My strategy worked on one point of failure. The LCD on one of the machines died, so I quickly swapped out the hard drive and was up and running in about five minutes.</p>\n<p>The ironic part is that the LCD died on the second machine, too!</p>\n<p>So I had to buy a new machine, and I didn't have any money to buy one. Thankfully I found an open box special at my local MicroCenter; an Acer 5742-6682 for about $300. At this point, I could simply swap out the hard drives, but I also wanted dual boot. So I figured a new install was in order. Should I got with Ubuntu again? Probably not, I don't like the new Gnome 3 shell and Ubuntu Unity thing they've got going on. So I tok a look at Mint Linix, a GNU/Linux system based off of Ubuntu (and of course Debian - the universal operating system) that focuses on simplicity.</p>\n<p>I tried out Mint Linux, and I'm so glad I did. Installing a dual boot system with a restored Windows 7 Home Edition couldn't have been easier, and the user interface of Mint is absolutely phenomenal.</p>\n<p>In short, Mint Linux 13 (Cappuccino) runs amazingly well on an Acer 5742-6682.\nIf you haven't tried Mint, I don't know what to tell you. I'm just soooo glad I'm using it!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2012/06/mint-linux-on-an-acer-5742-6682/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mint Linux on an Acer 5742 6682","date":"June 24th, 2012","tags":"debian,linux,mint,ubuntu"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2012/06/mint-linux-on-an-acer-5742-6682/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
