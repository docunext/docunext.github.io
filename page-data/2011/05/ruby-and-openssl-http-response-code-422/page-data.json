They involve OpenSSL and the 422 HTTP response code.</p>\n<h4>Ruby and OpenSSL</h4>\n<p>I tried using RVM on Debian Wheezy last week and <tt>rvm install ree</tt> was flailing miserably. A little spelunking led to the fact that Wheezy uses OpenSSL 1.x! Wow, imagine how long openssl has been around, and its finally reached \"1.0\"! Was there an announcement?</p>\n<p>The solution was not a big deal. While there are some patches to the ruby code, I opted to add the squeeze repositories and install openssl 0.9.8. The same should work for ubuntu, as I actually discovered many other folks who ran into a similar problem on ubuntu.</p>\n<h4>Response Code 422</h4>\n<p>While running a rails test this week, one of my assertions failed and I could not figure out why. I then dig some quick spelunking and found it to be that part of the controlled which response with \"unprocessable entity\" for XML requests. Indeed I was using <tt>xhr</tt> in my test. That really narrowed it down and I was able to change my xhr request to pass the assertion.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/05/ruby-and-openssl-http-response-code-422/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby and OpenSSL HTTP Response Code 422","date":"May 3rd, 2011","tags":"ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/05/ruby-and-openssl-http-response-code-422/"}}}
