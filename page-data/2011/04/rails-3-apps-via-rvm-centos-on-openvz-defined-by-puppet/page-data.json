I've done that, so I'll now map out the process for creating a new image from it, whereupon it will automatically ask puppet how to build itself, i.e. puppet needs to be configured! Unfortunately, I forgot about this step, so I have to wait for vzdump to finish...</p>\n<h4>Configuring Puppet on the Base CentOS Container</h4>\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">\n    package { \"gcc-c++\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"patch\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"readline\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"readline-devel\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"zlib\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"zlib-devel\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"libyaml-devel\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"libffi-devel\": ensure => installed }\n    package { \"openssl-devel\": ensure => installed }\n</pre>\n<p>One thing I'm realizing about puppet is that its modules don't have to always deal directly with packages... it can simply be used for configuration files, like resolv.conf. <strong>That is helpful</strong>.</p>\n<h4>What About LXC?</h4>\n<p>Lately I've been using lxc (GNU/Linux containers) and am quite pleased with the results. It doesn't require a custom kernel (though thanks to the awesomeness of Debian it is easy to obtain), and its easy to build Debian systems.</p>\n<p>I'll write another article about setting up Puppet within an LXC environment.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/04/rails-3-apps-via-rvm-centos-on-openvz-defined-by-puppet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rails 3 Apps via RVM CentOS on OpenVZ Defined by Puppet","date":"April 11th, 2011","tags":"ruby on rails"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/04/rails-3-apps-via-rvm-centos-on-openvz-defined-by-puppet/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
