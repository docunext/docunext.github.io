I first tried pressing \"C\" a non-Mac keyboard, but that just didn't work! Then I tried asking the system settings to boot off of the foreign operating system CD, but that didn't work either - I guess I burned a amd64 version of Wheezy by accident...</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the system would not boot off the hard drive again. At least I was able to eject the CD by holding down the <strong>left mouse button</strong> upon boot. Still, I was presented with the \"No Operating System Found\" error.</p>\n<p>Finally I figured I would try a real Mac keyboard. Wow - that worked! I was able to choose which OS by holding down the option key.</p>\n<p>Now I'm using \"diskutil\" to resize the volume so I can have at least 10GB of space to work with. I may end up removing Mac OS altogether, even.</p>\n<p>Actually, I'm running squeeze, and I like it because its super stable.</p>\n<p>Helpful Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bredsaal.dk/generating-entropy-with-a-wireless-network-card\">http://bredsaal.dk/generating-entropy-with-a-wireless-network-card</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/135944/2008/10/startupboot.html\">http://www.macworld.com/article/135944/2008/10/startupboot.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thiscoolsite.com/?tag=single-boot-linux-new-mac-mini\">http://www.thiscoolsite.com/?tag=single-boot-linux-new-mac-mini</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/04/debian-wheezy-on-an-older-mac-mini-mac-keyboard-needed/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Wheezy on an Older Mac Mini Mac Keyboard Needed","date":"April 29th, 2011","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/04/debian-wheezy-on-an-older-mac-mini-mac-keyboard-needed/"}}}
