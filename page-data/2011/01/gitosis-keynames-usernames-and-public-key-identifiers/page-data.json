For example, if the id</em>dsa.pub is something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nssh-dss ...dklfjdkfjshdf... joeschmoe@mylocalhost\n</pre>\n<p>The keyfile in gitosis-admin/keydir/can be name joeschmoe.pub, instead of joeschmoe@mylocalhost.pub. Note: the name used in gitosis.conf must match the name of the keyfile, minus the \".pub\"; in this example: \"joeschmoe\".</p>\n<p>Also noted is the fact that Gitosis does not remove the public key from the authorized<em>keys file in the gitosis user's .ssh folder when the user is no longer listed in gitosis.conf. In my usage, I switched from using the equivalent of joeschmoe@mylocalhost as the username to just joeschmoe. Since gitosis and ssh use the public key to identify the git-specific user, my usage with joeschmoe was failing because gitosis did not remove the first entry. I removed the authorized</em>keys entry manually, and then I was able to use joeschmoe.
