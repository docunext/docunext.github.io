Its not a bad client, but I'm surprised it was chosen over Thunderbird 3.0.</p>\n<p>I believe the decision was based on the fact that Evolution supports GPG. If I understand correctly, Thunderbird only supports GPG via a plugin, which is no longer maintained - enigmail.</p>\n<p>Evolution is close to being as good as Thunderbird, in my opinion. If it supported custom \"Sent\" folders, that would be a step in the right direction!</p>\n<h4>Sending Mail on an Alternate Port</h4>\n<p>SMTP uses port 25 by default, but many ISPs block port 25 in a lame attempt to limit spam. Therefore, many email users must use an alternate port, like port 587.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/01/evolution/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution","date":"January 1st, 2011","tags":"open source"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/01/evolution/"}},
