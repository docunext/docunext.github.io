I <em>believe</em> that this was caused primarily by an update to udev without and update to the kernel, or to sysv-rc.</p>\n<p>I'm running <tt>apt-get upgrade</tt> now, and I'm very hopeful that one of the updates will fix the problem. I'm very glad I had KVMOIP setup, as the server was simply offline, and its about 8 hours away. :-(</p>\n<p>Once I was able to access the console, the usual command did nothing:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n</pre>\n<p>Instead, I issued the following commands:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nifconfig eth0 192.168.8.12 netmask 255.255.255.0 up\nroute add default gw 192.168.8.1 eth0\nifconfig lo 127.0.0.1\n</pre>\n<p>Good, back online.</p>\n<h4>How to Restart Networking in Debian Squeeze</h4>\n<p>So if <tt>networking restart</tt> does not work, what does? A little research turns up this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ninvoke-rc.d networking restart\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Nope, still no luck on why no networking in starting on this machine. It has other problems, so I can't diagnose at the moment.</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2011/01/replacement-cr2032-battery-for-tyan-thunder-k8s-pro.html\">server at least needs a new CMOS battery (CR2302)</a>, and after that, I plan to do a complete re-install of Debian Squeeze, including a change from RAID5 to RAID10.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/01/debian-squeeze-networking-and-sysv-rc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Squeeze Networking and Sysv rc","date":"January 12th, 2011","tags":"debian,networking,openvz,raid,squeeze,udev"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/01/debian-squeeze-networking-and-sysv-rc/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
