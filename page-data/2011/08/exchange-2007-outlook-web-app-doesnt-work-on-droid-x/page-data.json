In general though, I can't accept that Microsoft doesn't support any other mail clients besides Outlook. That is totally anti-competitive, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Department of Justice took their butt back to court!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I was wrong! Exchange 2007 Outlook Web App <strong>does</strong> work with the Droid X browser. One of my co-workers also has a Droid X and said it worked for him, so I gave it a second try and voila! Indeed, the Outlook Web App (OWA) in Exchange 2007 <strong>does</strong> work with the WebKit-powered Droid X browser. The screen is tight, but its definitely usable and useful.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/08/exchange-2007-outlook-web-app-doesnt-work-on-droid-x/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Exchange 2007 Outlook Web App Doesn t Work on Droid X","date":"August 13th, 2011","tags":"droid,microsoft,outlook"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/08/exchange-2007-outlook-web-app-doesnt-work-on-droid-x/"}},
