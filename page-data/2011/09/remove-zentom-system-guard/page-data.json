Everything I tried was foiled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unable to start task manager</li>\n<li>Unable to uninstall it via the control panel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only thing that kind of worked was powershell, and then launching the task manager from administrative tools.</p>\n<p>Too bad there are just as many crappy websites out there selling and offering software that could be just as obnoxious as Zentom System Guard.</p>\n<p>I thought Windows 7 had resolved this issue of malware that affects Microsoft operating systems. Apparently not.</p>\n<p>I think I was able to remove Zentom. One of the tactics they use is to randomize the name of the executable. In my place, it was: kocinc700k.exe. Perhaps the publisher stays the same. For me it was Innoware Corp. - apparently a real company but from what I gather has nothing to do with software.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I've since completely rebuilt this machine using the restore functionality included by Lenovo.</p>\n<p>So far, so good, but I do note that since I've now enabled Windows auto-upgrades, the notebook reboots unexpectedly and its very annoying.</p>\n<p>In the future I might try Malwarebytes.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/09/remove-zentom-system-guard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Remove Zentom System Guard","date":"September 3rd, 2011","tags":"microsoft"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/09/remove-zentom-system-guard/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
