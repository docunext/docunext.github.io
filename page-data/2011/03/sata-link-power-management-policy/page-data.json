I wonder what is up with this?</p>\n<p>Based on some quick research, it seems like some hardware doesn't support min_power, or that the drivers for them just aren't set up right yet.</p>\n<p>For what its worth, I was wondering what other options might apply here and found medium_power; that doesn't work for me either.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/03/sata-link-power-management-policy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SATA Link Power Management Policy","date":"March 19th, 2011","tags":"power,sata"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/03/sata-link-power-management-policy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
