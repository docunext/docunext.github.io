I haven't had a chance to dig into it yet, but it looks great - its heavy.\n<p>It features forewords by David Heinemeier Hansson and Yehuda Katz, and I noted that the larger sections include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ActiveRecord</li>\n<li>Helpers</li>\n<li>ActiveSupport</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm really looking into reading this tome.</p>\n<h4>Routing</h4>\n<p>I'm reading the routing section now, and so far its very clear. I'm pleased that routing feels a little bit like Sinatra to me! This is especially nice because the main reason I used Sinatra was because of how simple and light it <em>was</em>, and since then its grown a lot more heavy - all the while Rails 3 got a lot more modular.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/03/the-rails-3-way/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of The Rails 3 Way by Obie Fernandez","date":"March 14th, 2011","tags":"activerecord,activesupport,rails,ruby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/03/the-rails-3-way/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3388129809"]}
