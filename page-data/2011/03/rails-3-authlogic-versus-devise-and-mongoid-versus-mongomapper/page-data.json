However, even though this is a content management system, the documents will be highly structured, so something like grit or git-wiki would not be sufficient.</p>\n<p>I started my review with MongoMapper. How very cool? Its an ORM wrapper to MongoDB. It worked for me right out of the box, and I found a really cool versioned plugin, so everything seemed to be rocking.</p>\n<p>When I tried connecting MongoMapper with AuthLogic, I got really stuck. I hacked and hacked but finally gave in and looked for alternatives. Lo and behold, right there on the feature request for AuthLogic to support MongoMapper at Github was a comment about how Devise supported Mongoid. I'd read good things about Devise, so I decided to give Mongoid a try.</p>\n<p>Getting Devise set up took about as long as AuthLogic did, and connecting it to Mongoid <em>could not have been quicker or simpler</em>!</p>\n<p>Mongoid even includes a version module! It doesn't seem to be outrageously efficient when it comes to managing the space requirements of different versions, but that's not my goal here.</p>\n<p>Working with Devise went very well, too. It seems to be as straightforward as AuthLogic, and I noticed many nice generators that came along with it. Since I am using Haml these days, I was a little disappointed to discover that Devise has dropped support for Haml templates in its generators. Not a big deal, I could override by speficifying -e \"erb\".</p>\n<p>I've really just scratched the surface with these two gems and I've already found some really cool stuff!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2011/03/rails-3-authlogic-versus-devise-and-mongoid-versus-mongomapper/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rails 3 AuthLogic versus Devise and Mongoid versus MongoMapper","date":"March 30th, 2011","tags":"authlogic,devise,rails3"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/03/rails-3-authlogic-versus-devise-and-mongoid-versus-mongomapper/"}},
