### First Impressions
Here's what I liked about what I saw when examining pycoon:
* Recently updated / worked on (2007)
* Compliant with cocoon's sitemap
* Decent documentation
* Influenced by WSGI

### Installing and Using Pycoon
Was able to install by following instructions from http://pycoon.pbwiki.com/Quick+starter+guide . Main page loads but others give errors:

<pre>
Resource Not Found

ResourceNotFoundException: No pipeline matched request: "/samples/blocks/pycoon/foo/"
</pre>

Getting fmt_textile was very easy, I just ran easy_install textile and tried again.

### Pycoon Configuration and Resource Files
The default when starting pycoon on my server is pycoon.xconf which loads the webapp/sitemap.xmap sitemap file. This is fairly similar to the config.xml and sitemap.xml files I'm familiar with on [[Nexista]].

### Next Steps
I'm interested to learn if pycoon can interface with python-xml and python-libxslt1 (packages on debian). That would be sweet!
