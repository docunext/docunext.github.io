FreeBSD is a free and open source UNIX operating system, complete with kernel
and userland.

#### FreeBSD Ports Collection

The FreeBSD ports collection makes it easy to install customized software
packages on FreeBSD. Ports are instructions and Makefiles to assist in the
installation of thousands of software packages. They require custom compilation,
so it takes some extra time to install them, but they are lightweight and
reliable.

For larger software installs, binary packages are available which can be
installed like so:

    pkg_add -r vim-lite

#### Example Port Installation

    cd /usr/ports/somedir/someprogram/
    make && make install && make clean

#### Ports Maintenance

The cvsup tool is used to update a FreeBSD Ports tree.

    cvsup -g -L 2 /etc/supfile

And the freebsd-update tool can be used to update binary packages, including the
system itself.

#### What makes FreeBSD different from Ubuntu or Debian?

* Ubuntu and [[/Debian]] are comprised of the GNU userland and the linux kernel
* The linux kernel is licensed under the GPL2 license
* FreeBSD has no /proc/ filesystem
* FreeBSD is liberally licensed under the BSD license
