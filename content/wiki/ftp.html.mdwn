### FTP Summary
File Transfer Protocol, despite its shortcomings, FTP is still quite popular due to its convenience. Personally, I never use it. Instead I use [[SCP]] (secure copy), of [[DAV]] over [[SSL]].

I do provide the service for some clients though, and I use [[proftpd]] on debian. It seems to work fine for the majority of the time.

I've also installed [[pureftpd]], and though I had some difficulties getting it running on OpenVZ, it did end up working OK.

### Rounding Up FTP Servers
I thought of trying to use [[FTP Proxy]] to act as a gateway / filter / router, but in the end I used [[NFS]] to mount ftp shares to a single ftp server. Works fine for my needs.

Will [[ftp.proxy]] do the trick?

### FTP Topics
#### Passive FTP
This is a common setting which is usually used as a workaround for users behind a [[firewall]].
