### DHIS Summary
I believe that this is a dynamic [[DNS]] solution of sorts... yes, it could be more than that too, not sure yet.

### My Experience with DHIS
I stopped using dynamic [[DNS]] services from dyndns for two reasons:
* No glue for .com names from .org dyndns nameservers
* I didn't want to use my account password to update the host record

Its taken me awhile but I decided to simply try another service, like dhis.org, so I signed up for a free account and install dhis-client on a debian machine.

I'm using it to update a record of the public address of my laptop computer. This is helpful for a couple of reasons:
* It will help track it down in case it gets stolen
* I'm using it to open ports on certain servers using [[iptables]]
