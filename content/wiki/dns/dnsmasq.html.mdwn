### Dnsmasq Summary
Dnsmasq is a caching, non-authoritative [[DNS]] server / forwarder. It is small, efficient, and lightweight. It is available as a [[Debian]] package, and it is also notably included in [[pfSense]] as the [[DNS]] forwarder and [[DHCP]] server.

### My Configuration
<pre>
domain-needed
bogus-priv
no-resolv
server=192.168.8.1
server=4.2.2.1
</pre>

Obviously I don't use the [[DHCP]] capabilities with this configuration!
