I always compare DNS to a phone book, you know the person or company you want to
call, but don't know their number. DNS is more convenient for sure: you ask the
internet for what you want (most likely along the lines of a [[domain name]]),
and it looks up the number for you, using DNS.

To keep DNS fast and reliable, distributed redundancy is a key component. Most
domain names have their "names and numbers" stored at various locations. The
problem with this is keeping all the data in sync. Luckily DNS has some
solutions for that, too.

The serial number confirms records are the same, and [[AXFR]] to synchronize
zone files.

Use dig to query DNS:

    dig www.docunext.com

Dig a specific record and use a specific name server:

    dig A docunext.com @4.2.2.1

How to perform a reverse lookup?

    dig -x 4.2.2.1

* [[/dns/BIND]]
* [[/dns/Dnsmasq]]
