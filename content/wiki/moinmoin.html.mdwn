MoinMoin is an actively developed, GPL licensed, python powered wiki engine. Since it is used by many prominent sites (like [[Apache]]), I imagine the software is high quality, so I'm going to review it in my efforts to learn more about [[Python]].

Looks like MoinMoin can run as a [[WSGI]] application, using flup, or a standard CGI, or via the [[Python Twisted]] server.

In reviewing some python files, I've noticed this at the top:
<pre>
# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
</pre>

I wonder is this is common to python practices?

I also notice that many python programs make extensive use of the "from" statement when importing modules. Doesn't this negate the benefit of namespaces?

### My Experience with MoinMoin
As of August 2008, I'm finally getting around to using MoinMoin. I've written my own wiki application, [[Private Wiki]], which uses the [[PEAR Text_Wiki]] parser, but for public wikis, I've mostly used [[MediaWiki]]. I like MediaWiki, but it might be too "big" for some of my needs. I'm using MoinMoin to create a films wiki on [http://www.neofilmz.com NeoFilmz.com].

I was nervous there was no category support, but I guess there is. Its accomplished using [[BackLinks]], and I still have to figure out how to use it properly.

After a few days of using MoinMoin, I still really like it. The only complaint I have is that users access rights are managed via the configuration file. That can get laborious. On the other hand, I think they are trying to encourage people to retain the community style wiki functionality, instead of using it as [[CMS]].

#### Migration, Backups, and Restore
After trying out MoinMoin on a small [[kvm]] powered virtual machine, I'm planning to setup a more robust implementation on a [[XEN]] virtual server. Not that XEN is any more robust, but the configuration and server that XEN is running on is more stable.

Anyway, I'm looking into migrating some Moin wikis, and since its related, I'm researching how to backup and restore Moin wikis (in fact that might be the easiest way to migrate).
