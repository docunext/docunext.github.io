This is a new page based of a huge post in the [http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/07/can-this-router-run-linux.html docunext blog, called Can this router run linux?]

### Hardware Specs
* SD9148 MIPS R3000 processor 200Mhz ([[CPU]])
* 64MB of RAM (?)
* [http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=17&PFid=12&Level=5&Conn=4&ProdID=28 Realtek ethernet chipset RTL8028] - 1 WAN, 4 LAN -
* USB host connector (1.1?)

### Firmware
The only firmware I could find that works on the IS050t has the following files:

* Binary Image/IS050t-S-00-09-07p - 1MB
* IS050t-S-00-09-07P.img - 660KB

Here is the output generated by running the binary file through "strings IS050t-S-00-09-07p > blah.txt": [[IS050t-S-00-09-07P strings]]

I then tried uncompressing a portion of the img file, and found a lot more information. It even contained a lot of the web pages that are served by the device.

In working with this device, I would like to be able to flash it with new firmware that would allow greater capabilities for its operation. I would like to be able to access a shell, for example. To accomplish this goal, I imagine I'd need to cross compile and build a new firmware image. As I understand it, I could use the uClinux or linux-mips toolchains to accomplish this goal, but there are some caveats:
# When uploading firmware to the IS050t, the device runs some checks - a CRC checksum, as well as a gzip magic number check (I think?)
# The firmware has to actually work when it is flashed and loaded. :-)

There has been a ton of work done in this area for wireless routers like the Linksys WRT54GL, but the community seems to be quite fractured and disorganized with various priorities and issues.

So why would I want to do this? Well for a few reasons:
* Learn more about embedded projects
* Potentially get a more useful router
* Share what I'm able to learn with others

Figuring it wouldn't matter if I bricked it, I tried uploading a few random firmwares, but they didn't work of course!

### Serial Connection
I think it will be possible to make a serial connection to the INEXQ IS050t. However, I just used my trusty voltmeter to test the voltage on the J213 pinouts, and the voltage is 3.26V. That would suggest that I'll need an adjustment to connect to a 12V serial connection.

The RTL8181 project at sourceforge is a treasure trove of information for all things linux and micro-embedded linux. They have a ton of information on a variety of devices. One page I found particularly helpful was this one: [http://rtl8181.sourceforge.net/pinouts_7206APB.php it depicts a board with a pinout, and then has a circuit diagram showing how to "make the connection"]. The [http://hri.sourceforge.net/ Hardware Recycling Initiative] is also very helpful when it comes to a wider range of routers and stuff.
