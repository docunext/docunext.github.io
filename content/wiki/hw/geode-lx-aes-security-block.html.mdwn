NAME
     glxsb - Geode LX Security Block crypto accelerator

SYNOPSIS
     glxsb* at pci?

DESCRIPTION
     The glxsb driver supports the security block of the Geode LX series pro-
     cessors.  The Geode LX is a member of the AMD Geode family of integrated
     x86 system chips.

     Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator, glxsb
     supplies entropy to the random(4) driver for common usage.

     glxsb also supports acceleration of AES-CBC operations for crypto(4).

SEE ALSO
