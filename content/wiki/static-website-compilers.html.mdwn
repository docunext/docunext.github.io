Here is a list of the growing numbers of static website compilers available under open source licenses:

* [[Hakyll]] ([[Haskell]])
* [[Yst]] ([[Haskell]])
* [[Jekyll Ruby]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Webgen]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Nanoc]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[StaticMatic]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Middleman]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Yurt]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Website Meta Language]]
* [[Chronicle]] ([[Perl]]?)
* [[Ikiwiki]] ([[Perl]])
* [[Bonsai]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Pekky]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Grackle]] ([[Lua]])
* [[Miril]] ([[Perl]])
* [[Chisel]] ([[Python]])
* [[Wax]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Igor]] ([[Python]])
* [[Lanyon]] ([[Python]])
* [[Phooey]] ([[PHP]])
* [[Golbarb]] ([[Python]])
* [[Growl]] ([[Python]])
* [[Blogofile]] ([[Python]])
* [[Genstatic]] ([[Python]])
* [[AYM CMS]] ([[Python]])
* [[Tiny CMS]] ([[Ruby]])
* [[Movable Type]] ([[Perl]])

Its interesting how many are written in [[Ruby]] and [[Python]]! Some, like [[Movable Type]], use a [[relational database]] back-end, though it seems like most use static files as the storage system as well, which is nice because it means that the content can be managed with a [[revision control system]], like [[Git]]!

Also, most of these compilers use [[Markdown]], [[Textile]], or [[HAML]], but notably, some use [[Django]] templates (mostly those coded in [[Python]]).
