Installation was a breeze, like usual on [[debian]], just:
<pre>
apt-get install nagios3
</pre>
Lots of dependencies, a quick question about [[Samba]], then I did this:
<pre>
cd /etc/nagios3
htpasswd -c htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
</pre>
Then I was able to login via the web interface, nice! And another nice surprise - they added the default gateway as a bonus. Cool!
