### Summary
A RAID is a redundant array of independent disks. I used to favor raid5, but now I am using raid10.

* RAID0 - no redundancy, speedy
* RAID1 - mirrored disks
* RAID5 - three or more disks required
* RAID6 -
* RAID10 - RAID1 over RAID0, speedy and redundant, but requires a lot of drives

### Software RAID
I've used this on both [[Debian GNU/Linux]] ([[mdadm]]) and [[FreeBSD]] ([[geom]]) with great success.

Example:
<pre>
$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1]
md1 : active raid1 sda3[0] sdb3[1]
      239312192 blocks [2/2] [UU]

md2 : active raid0 sda2[0] sdb2[1]
      7807360 blocks 64k chunks

md0 : active raid1 sda1[0] sdb1[1]
      979840 blocks [2/2] [UU]
</pre>

I want to try [[RAIDframe]] on [[NetBSD]].

### [[Hardware]] RAID
I've also used hardware RAID systems quite successfully, [[Adaptec]], [[3Ware]] cards and more recently [[Areca]].
