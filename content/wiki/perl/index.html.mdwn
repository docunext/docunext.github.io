### Summary
Perl has a kazillion modules. I just found out about [[DJabberd]], and I'm now reading a couple of Perl books on O'Reilly's Safari service and I'm really liking "Learning Perl" so far, and "Perl Cookbook" reads really well too.

Perl shipped a newer version of Perl 5 in December of 2007. [[Perl6]] (aka [[Parrot]]) looks very interesting too.
