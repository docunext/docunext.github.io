Perl subroutines are in my opinion similar to what I call functions in a language like [[PHP]]. Inasmuch, I've used them to isolate different components of my programs into different subroutines.

### Subroutine Example
<pre>
sub smarminator {

    return $_[0];

}
</pre>

This is similar, but quite different than what I'm used to. First off, there are no parentheses to pass parameters. A little delving reveals that the $_@ array is for those - ha! The smarminator subroutine mentioned above will simply return the first value which is sent to it.
