### Summary
C is a little difficult for me to understand because it is very technical and precise in its syntax and formatting.

Slowly I am figuring it out a little here and a little there. I've been experimenting with C++ too.

### Standard Library
Is there anything much more exciting than a standard library? I didn't think so.

Much of [[linux]]'s success is thanks to [[glibc]] and [[gcc]] (in my opinion)! There are some issues though, I guess malloc has had some problems, which in some cases can be fixed by using [[tcmalloc]] instead.
