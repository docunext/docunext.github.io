I use iscsi with [[Debian]] as the initiator (client) and [[FreeNAS]] as the target. Works OK so far, haven't done any extreme testing.

Following the advice on the [[Debian]] wiki, I am able to get the iSCSI device upon reboot, but not mounted at reboot. I can manually mount it though. Hmmmm, it contains some information about labels, so a little further research finds the Bob Cares website. Thanks Bob for suggesting e2label.

### Tests
Tried to get two iscsi devices to build a [[RAID]] 1. I got it to build, but upon reboot /proc/mdstat had nothing to say about it. Though I was glad to see that one of the iscsi devices mounted in its place. Next up... [[LVM]]. Nope, that didn't work either. Maybe there is a [[userland]] tool which could provide some mirroring capability, like [[incrond]].

Yes, this seems like it will work OK:
<pre>
/mnt/sda1/ IN_MODIFY /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete /mnt/sda1/ /mnt/sdb1
</pre>

### Usage
On [[debian]], I find these commands helpful:
<pre>
iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 192.168.8.7
</pre>

<pre>
iscsiadm -m node --logoutall=all
iscsiadm -m node -o show
iscsiadm -m node -o delete
</pre>
