## GRE Tunneling Between [[FreeBSD]] and [[GNU/Linux]] is AWESOME!

I've been wanting to do this for sooooo long!

### Basic Steps

1. Add [[GRE]] tunnel
2. Add new interface - select GRE Tunnel as endpoint
3. Enable new interface, configure with local address of gre tunnel (private ip)
4. Setup firewall rules for new interface
5. Confirm interface on interface overview page
6. Test with [[ping]]
