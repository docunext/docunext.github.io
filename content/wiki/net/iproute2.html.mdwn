### Summary
iproute is a very powerful [[routing]] system for [[linux]] but documentation can be daunting to networking novices.

I've used the following tools:

### ip
The "ip" command is central to the iproute2 tool. It uses options like "tunnel", "link", "addr" and more to get specific. I used the "ip" tool to create a [[GRE]] tunnel, and I was quite pleased with the result.

### tc
"Traffic control" is used for throttling bandwidth.
