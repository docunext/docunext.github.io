I'm getting more interested in sockets, especially UNIX sockets.

### Servers that use Unix Sockets
* [[FastCGI]] services can use Unix Sockets
* [[MySQL]] can be accessed via Unix sockets

### Web Servers that can listen on Unix Sockets
* [[Lighttpd]] - http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Server.bindDetails
* [[AOLServer]] -
* [[Perl]] HTTP:Daemon - http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.825/lib/HTTP/Daemon.pm

### Proxy Servers that can use Unix Sockets as a back-end
* [[Pound]]
* [[NGINX]]
* [[MySQL Proxy]] - actually, maybe this can listen on a unix socket?
I wish all of these could use unix sockets as their front end too! And I wish [[Varnish]] was in this group as well.

### Socket Tools
* [[Socat]]
