Building the network.

Needs:
1.Security (VPN – openswan?)
2.Simplicity (linux, Mac OS X, BSD)
3.Speed (DSL, Squid, LAN, mirrored fileservers)
4.Single authentication database (ldap, pam, etc.)
5.Redundancy (Cable and DSL backup)
6.Uninterruptible power supply for longer than 11 minutes?
7.Incredibly high performing web server for colo

Equipment:
1.1000Mbit/s Switch
2.(2) 1+ TB fileservers, one for Local, and one for colo
a.Local Server – needs to perform a multitude of services, requiring substantial processing and memory resources
i.Samba
ii.VPN server (openswan)
iii.Firewall (IPTables)
iv.Proxy server (squid)
v.RAID controller, with battery backup
vi.Web server
vii.MySQL server
viii.Controller card with battery backup cache
b.Colo
i.Samba
ii.VPN server
iii.Firewall

Budget:
$25,000?

Expectations, to last at least seven years with 99.9% uptime performance.

Uncontrollable, acceptable factors:
1.Power – too expensive to make redundant beyond a 5 minute power outage, which is probably the most common problem, use a battery backup cache on the controller card for Local
2.Internet connection – having cable as the main connection with DSL as backup would cost an additional $100 / month.
3.Machine failure – a hard drive or machine could fail, causing the system to malfunction. Use RAID 5, without hotswap option, where one drive could fail. Use Seagate drives that come with a 5 year warranty.
4.Fire, theft, or other destruction – use offsite backups at Colo
