The Amazon Kindle is an e-reader. It has remarkable battery life thanks to its use of e-ink. The Kindle has been a phenomenal success, though it likely does not mark the downfall of the printed book.

On September 28, 2011, Amazon released their first Kindle without e-ink: the Kindle Fire. It has a color LCD display so that it can support Amazon's new browser - the [[Amazon Silk]].
