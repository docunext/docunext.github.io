This is a handy [[Bash]] [[shell]] script I use quite often:

<pre class="sh_sh">
ls -1Ra | wc | awk '{printf("There are %s files in this directory!\n",$1-2)}'
</pre>

What does it do? It recursively counts all the files within the current.

For example:

<pre class="sh_sh">
root@pro-31-gl:/srv/ftp/upload# ls -1Ra | wc | awk '{printf("There are %s files in this directory!\n",$1-2)}'
There are 7664 files in this directory!
</pre>
