Asterisk is an [[open source]] phone system, or a private business extender (PBX) to be more precise.

#### AskoziaPBX

AskoziaPBX is a FreeBSD distribution and a super-duper phone system. Using asterisk and a m0n0wall base, it is a very capable operating system for managing multiple phone extensions, and connecting them to a voip service provider.

I've been using askoziaPBX for over three months as of November 2007, and although we have very light call demand, the platform is has worked absolutely flawless for us.
