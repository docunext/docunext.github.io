I'm planning to setup a PXE boot environment, meaning a separate network for a PXE boot [[TFTP]] server, [[DHCP]] server, and their clients.

### PXE Boot Server Specs
* Separate router (with DHCPd) and TFPD/NFS server
* Multiple OS: at least linux and freebsd

### PXE Boot Plan
I'm planning to use [[FreeNAS]] as the [[NFS]] server, and m0n0wall as the DHCPd server. I'm not sure what I'm going to use for the TFTPD server though. I might be able to only use NFS and not use TFTP.

I'll use a 10/100 switch, though I'd rather a 10/100/1000. I might use a small 10/100/1000 for the NFS server, and a larger 10/100 for the clients.

### Experimenting
Turns out that [[VirtualBox]] can boot from the network - excellent! Thanks to [http://www.bgevolution.com/blog/pxe-network-boot-virtualbox/ bgevolution].
