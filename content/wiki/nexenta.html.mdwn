### Summary
Nexenta is an [[opensolaris]] open source operating system and applications distribution with [[apt-get]] capabilities. Even though its fairly young, it has a lot of history with [[Solaris]], [[ZFS]], and zones. It appears that they are aligning their distribution based on [[Ubuntu]] instead of [[Debian]].

### Nexenta Versions
I've only been able to get Nexenta core platform 1.0 to work. The core platform 2.0 looks cool, but it keeps just restarting whenever I try to boot it up. I have confirmed this on a [[KVM]] virtual machine, and I think its happened on real machines I've tried to install it on.

### Nexenta Zones
This is very cool - its like [[OpenVZ]] and [[FreeBSD Jails]], but also like [[KVM]] or [[Xen]], because it is able to emulate virtual hardware. I guess [[OpenVZ]] and jails do that too, and I'm not sure if each zone would have a separate kernel or not.

Here's where I'm going to get started:
http://www.nexenta.org/os/ConfiguringNexentaZone

But I'm getting this error:
<pre>
Nexenta zone requires ZFS filesystem with mount point /zone/4, can't proceed further
</pre>

I was able to work around this by:
<pre>
zfs create syspool/zone
zfs create syspool/zone/zone4
zfs list
zfs set mountpoint=/zone syspool/zone
chmod 0700 /zone/zone4/
zoneadm -z zone4 install
</pre>

Hmmm, I must have done something wrong - it crashed halfway through. I tried my darndest the day after to create another machine running Nexenta but had many many issues. I'm going to hold off for awhile - maybe until it becomes a part of [[Debian]].
