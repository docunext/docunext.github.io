### TCL Summary
"The Command Language"

I first came into contact with TCL when trying to use [[OpenACS]], an online community in a box. I found out about it through [[Philip Greenspun]]'s various websites, like Photo.net.

Its been awhile since then, and I'm now getting interested in [[AOLServer]] and TCL again because I'm porting [[Nexista]] to  few different languages. Since TCL has decent support for [[XML]] and [[XSLT]], as well as many database drivers and database abstraction layers, it should be a good fit, it might even work out better than the other languages I've been working with: [[Perl]], [[Python]], and [[PHP]].

### TCL Packaging
I like it when languages have formal packaging procedures, and TCL sure does! This was the only page which helped me figure it out:
