On [[Debian]], there are some configuration files in /etc/spamassassin:
<pre>
65_debian.cf
init.pre
local.cf
v320.pre
</pre>

Maybe some others. The *.pre files load plugins, and local.cf is for custom site rules and configuration. I mainly use local.cf for setting some custom points as well as passlists.
