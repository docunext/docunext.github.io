OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite of software packages. It includes:

* oowriter for [[word processing]]
* oocalc for [[spreadsheet]]
* ooimpress for presentations
* oodraw for [[graphics]]

There are some other tools it includes, but those are the ones I use.

### Saving Data in OpenOffice.org Formats
OpenOffice.org files are .[[zip]] archives. The archives contain a bunch of metadata files, as well as an [[XML]] file that contains the document data. In [[PBooks]], I was able to manually create an OpenOffice.org archive using [[PHP]] and [[XSLT]]. Here's a link to the [http://www.pbooks.org/src/view/pre/trunk/apps/pbooks/templates/xml/open_spreadsheet.xml.xsl xsl template] I used.

### Locking Rows from Scrolling
I had a difficult time hunting down how to do this. Its called "Freezing Rows" and is accessed under the "Windows" menubar drop down.
