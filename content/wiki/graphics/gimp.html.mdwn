### Summary
After many years at the controls of Photoshop, switching to the GIMP is little difficult. However, the price tag makes the transition a little bit easier. I'm doing less and less graphic design these days and more and more programming, so it doesn't make sense for me to buy a Photoshop license for myself.

Instead, I'm buying [[Adobe Photoshop]] and other [[Adobe]] software for my graphic designers, who will use it all day long. Instead, I'll use the GIMP when I need to edit graphics, and [[Inkwell]] when I need to edit vectors.

### My Continued Experience
The gimp is getting easier to use now that I am using it more often. I still have a few complaints about the [[user interface]], so maybe I'll use that as an excuse to delve into the code!
