### Summary
Pdftk is a [[PDF]] toolkit. At first I found the command syntax to be a little confusing, but now I've getting comfortable with it.

### Example Usage
Here's some examples I've recently done:

* Join multiple [[PDF]]s:
<pre class="sh_sh">
pdftk black.pdf gray.pdf cat output 2006_sf.pdf
</pre>

* Remove page 4 from a multipage [[PDF]]:
<pre class="sh_sh">
pdftk 2006_salem_five.pdf cat 1-3 5 output new.pdf
</pre>

I guess the pdftk "cat" command is just as powerful and useful as the [[userland]] [[cat]] tool.
