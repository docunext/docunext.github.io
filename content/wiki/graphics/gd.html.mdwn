GD is a handy library which can be used to manipulate images. There are bindings for a ton of languages:
* [[PHP]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Lua]]

It can be used to edit images in a programmatic manner, such as resizing, cropping, and optimizing, as well as generating graphics such as gradients, test, and shapes.
