SASL stands for simple "simple authentication security layer". In its simplest form, it simply says the equivalent of "OK" or "Not OK" with regard to a user's attempt to authenticate.

### Saslauthd
This is an authentication daemon which can use a variety of back-ends for checking credentials, like [[pam]], passwd, [[kerberos5]], [[LDAP]], even something called "sasldb". It can even authenticate against a remote [[IMAP]] server.

### SASL Implementations
In the open source world, I'm aware of two SASL implementations:

* Cyrus
* [[/Dovecot]]

### SASL Authentication Mechanisms

#### Sasldb

I'm wondering about SASL for SMTP authentication by machines, and thinking about using sasldb. I've never used it before but it reminds me a little bit like htpasswd or htdigest

There are a few commands for managing a sasldb:

<pre>
saslauthd           sasldbconverter2    sasldblistusers2
saslpasswd2         saslpluginviewer    sasl-sample-client  sasl-sample-server
</pre>

#### Sasl and [[/LDAP]]
This is a very interesting possibility. I've just installed it on a test machine
and can't seem to figure out how to configure it. The /etc/default/saslauthd
file says LDAP is configured in /etc/saslauthd.conf.

#### SASL and IMAP Servers
This is the back-end I most commonly use. On [[Debian]] servers, I add this to
the configuration:

    MECHANISMS="rimap"
    MECH_OPTIONS="localhost/143"
