ledger -f ko.txt bal
               $3155  Assets
              $-2655  Equity
               $-500  Liabilities
</pre>

The accounting equation is such that Assets = Equity + Liabilities. In this case, $3155 does not equal $-3155. How come? The ledger documentation to try putting -Equity at the end:

<pre>
               $3155  Assets
               $-500  Liabilities
--------------------
               $2655
</pre>

Hmm, still not making much sense to me. How about:
<pre>
ledger -f ko.txt bal -Equity -Liabilities
               $3155  Assets
--------------------
               $3155
</pre>

Yeah, that sort of works. Does this show that Ledger doesn't have a concept of debits or credits, and the normal balance of standard account types? Possibly.
