Csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool. I use it for synchronizing simple configuration files in sync across multiple hosts. Here's what I'm currently synchronizing:

<pre>
include /etc/csync2.cfg;
include /etc/ssh/ssh_config;
include /etc/vim/vimrc;
include /etc/default/ntpdate;
include /etc/sudoers;
include /etc/timezone;
include /etc/subversion/config;
include /etc/aliases;
include /etc/postfix/main.cf;
</pre>

Csync2:
* Uses [[SQLite]] to keep track of files
* Is fast
* Uses ssl and certificates for security
