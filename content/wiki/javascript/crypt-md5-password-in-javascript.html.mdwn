This doesn't exist and I was planning to write it based upon the following ideas, but the need to iterate 1000 times in [[javascript]] and perform the necessary evaluations and computations within each iteration is not reasonably fast, so I've ditched the idea for now.

The big problem here is that most crypt-md5 implementations use a 1000 iteration loop, which will cause javascript to go very very slow. With a quick search I found this cool page:

which may help to make crypt md5 possible in javascript.

Alternatively, the password could be encrypted using RSA in the browser, then decrypted on the server, then hashed using crypt-md5, and compared to the stored password.

The goal of all this is to provide portable passwords (which can be used for multiple purposes / protocols) that can be transferred in some form of "better than cleartext" across the internet.
