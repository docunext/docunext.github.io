### Summary
Rsync is a very cool program - it can synchronize really well. The nice thing about rsync is that it only synchronizes files that have changed. It is usually run from the [[command line]].

### Mirroring
Rsync can be used to mirror file systems, however, the recursive option can be an unnecessarily intense option, especially for pushing. Here's some thoughts I have on how to reduce the amount of work necessary to only update the recently changed files (these would need to be changed depending on how I used them):
<pre>
find . -maxdepth 3 -mmin -30 - exec rsync {} ...

</pre>

### Resource Consumption
Rsync can use a lot of resources! In late 2009 I started configuring /etc/default/rsync to include:
<pre>
RSYNC_NICE='10'
</pre>

### Rsync Errors
This isn't really an error, but it appears when the unexpected occurs:
<pre>
rsyncd-munged
</pre>
