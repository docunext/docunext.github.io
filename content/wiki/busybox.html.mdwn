Busybox is a really awesome open source project. It is a single binary that can perform many of the basic tasks required to administer a system, aka the [[userland]].

### Busybox Compile

<pre>
menu makeconfig
</pre>

### Busybox Install

'''I WILL NEVER RUN THIS ON A RUNNING SYSTEM. I WILL ONLY RUN IT ON A CHROOT I AM BUILDING.'''
<pre>
/bin/busybox --install -s
</pre>

This appears to symlink with /proc/self/exe instead of /bin/busybox.
