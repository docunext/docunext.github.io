Gitosis is a [[/Git]] repository management software package. It is written in
[[/Python]].

### Review
Gitosis is way better than I thought it would be. It was easy to setup, and it
works incredibly well. It works like this:

* A single system user is created for securely accessing git repositories
* [[/OpenSSH]] public keys are used for identification, authentication, and
  authorization
* A single gitosis.conf configuration file is used for access control
* The configuration of gitosis (including the public keys and gitosis.conf) is
  even a Git repository itself

Its beautifully simple!

I'm using it alongside [[/Redmine]], and the two really compliment each other.
