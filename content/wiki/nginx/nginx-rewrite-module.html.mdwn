I'm trying something like this:

<pre>
map $host $new {
www.example.com   www2.example.net
}

#rewrite  ^    $new   permanent;
</pre>

Not sure if it will work though, I need to try it out. It does work, but the rewrite permanent line needs to go into a location directory.

### Interesting
<pre>
    #if (-d $request_filename) {
    #    break;
    #}

    #if (-f $request_filename/index.html) {
    #    rewrite (.*) $1/index.html break;
    #}

    #if (-f $request_filename/index.html) {
    #    break;
    #}

    if (!-f $request_filename) {
        break;
        proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:6081;
    }
</pre>

Even if I set index to index.html, the above as-is will proxy when the request is for a directory and the path and index.html file exist. But if I un-comment out either of the top three if statements, the proxy is not invoked. I chose the third option as I think its the most efficient.
