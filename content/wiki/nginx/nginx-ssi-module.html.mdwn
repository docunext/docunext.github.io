### NGINX SSI Module Summary
I'm very pleased that [[NGINX]] has this module. SSI stands for server side includes, and they are about the simplest template system in existence. Several other web servers support server side includes, at least [[Apache]] does I know that for sure.

### My Experience with SSIs
At first I disregarded SSIs because they were too simple and limited for complex tasks. They are often too limited, but a nice quality of simplicity is that there is less change of error (at least in theory).

### SSI Example
In NGINX I'm using this for footer links:
<pre class="sh_html">
<!--# block name="empty" --><!--# endblock -->
<!--# include virtual="/s/ssi/footer_links.html" stub="empty" -->
<!--# echo var="myhost" -->
</pre>
This loads the footer_links.html file, and if it is unavailable substitutes the empty block instead. The virtual attribute is for http requests, so instead of an html file, a dynamic file could be requested to generate the block of content on the fly.

The last directive is an example of using a variable which can be set in the config file. For that variable to be set, I put this in my [[NGINX]] config file:
<pre>
set $myhost $host;
</pre>
