### Summary
Logical Volume Management (LVM) usually refers to the lvm2 user space tools, the device mapper kernel modules, and the libdevmapper supporting process.

Here are the kernel modules as they appear on one of my servers:
<pre>
dm_mirror              12820  -
dm_snapshot            11232  -
dm_mod                 38032  -
</pre>

### Create Physical Volume
pvcreate

<pre>
dev-48:/home/charliechokko# pvcreate /dev/sdaX
  Physical volume "/dev/sda6" successfully created
</pre>

### Create Volume Group
vgcreate
<pre>
dev-48:/home/djjazzygeoff# vgcreate xtra /dev/sdaX
  Volume group "xtra" successfully created
</pre>

### Create Logical Volume
<pre>
lvcreate --size 10GB --name newname xtra
</pre>

### Troubleshooting LVM
<pre>
Can't remove open logical volume ...
</pre>
Not sure how to fix this one. I ended up renaming the volume, replacing another volume with it, and removing that volume. Ha! Gotta lover the workarounds. Hmm, not able to remove the other one either. What gives?
