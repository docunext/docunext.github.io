I've heard this is a bit tricky, so I'm going to tread very lightly!

First I forced [[fsck]] on the next reboot, and rebooted. Then I tried this:
<pre>
# lvresize -L -1G /dev/mapper/lv891-root && resize2fs /dev/mapper/lv891-root
  WARNING: Reducing active and open logical volume to 71.91 GB
  THIS MAY DESTROY YOUR DATA (filesystem etc.)
Do you really want to reduce root? [y/n]: y
  Reducing logical volume root to 71.91 GB
  Logical volume root successfully resized
resize2fs 1.41.3 (12-Oct-2008)
Filesystem at /dev/mapper/lv891-root is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
On-line shrinking from 19113984 to 18851840 not supported.
</pre>

Hmm, OK, not supported. Doh! So I'm going to try and do a switcheroo. I'm forcing [[fsck]] again, and then I'll reduce another 5 or 6 gigabytes to relocate root on another filesystem, then I can take /dev/mapper/lv891-root offline for a rebuild / resize.

Argh, looks like its dead. Unfortunately I tried this on a machine I don't have physical access to right away. Its not a very important machine, so its OK. I can turn it off remotely so it doesn't just sit there doing nothing.
