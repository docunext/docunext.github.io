Postfix-gld is a greylisting daemon software package. It uses [[MySQL]] as its
database, and has some interesting and unique features:

* lightgrey option
* mx algorithm

### My Experience with postfix-gld
I've been using postfix-gld for about 12 months after using [[postgrey]] for
equally as long. I wanted to use postfix-gld so that I could share greylist data
across multiple servers. So far so good - its been working fine for me. The
[[database]] has grown quite large, so I think I need to figure out how to trim
it down some.

Thanks to hostingfu.com (see link below), this script can be put into a cron job and run periodically:

~~~
#!/bin/bash

# Expiring the greylist in 12 hours.
EXPIRE_GREYLIST=43200

# Expiring the whitelist in 35 days.
EXPIRE_WHITELIST=$((35 * 86400))

echo "
DELETE FROM greylist WHERE last<$((`date +%s` - EXPIRE_WHITELIST));
DELETE FROM greylist WHERE n=1 AND first<$((`date +%s` - EXPIRE_GREYLIST));
" | mysql gld
~~~

I just read that page again and there is an option from the command line which
does the same thing:

    gld -k 35

Actually the gld command line tool is quite useful, gld -i show database information:

~~~
# gld -i
# of entries in the database         : 330043
# of one hit entries in the database : 286254
Oldest entry in database             : 756 days ago
~~~

I'm also looking into using a [[dnspl]] with postfix-gld.
