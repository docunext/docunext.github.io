I'm pleasantly surprised by how similar these systems are.

### Things I like about [[CentOS]]
* [[Yum]] is fast and is powered by [[python]]
* Smaller set of packages is a good thing
* [[NSS]] [[LDAP]] setup was a breeze

### Things I like about [[Debian]]
* [[Apt-get]] is awesome!
* The development community is incredibly idealistic
* [[Debian]] supports multiple kernels: [[FreeBSD]] and [[Linux]]
