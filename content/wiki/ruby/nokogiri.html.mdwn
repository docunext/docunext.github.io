### Nokogiri Summary
Nokogiri is a [[Ruby]] extension for working with [[XML]] documents. It can do some [[XSLT]] style processing, and what I find to be very interesting is how flexible it is with node selection. Its a lot like [[JQuery]] in that way.

### Nokogiri Example
From [[NeoToyz]]:
<pre class="sh_ruby">
require 'xml/libxml'
require 'rubygems'
require 'nokogiri'

class Fence

    def initialize(fence_file)

        @fence_doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(fence_file))

    end

    def get_fence()
        return @fence_doc
    end

    def get_xsl(my_gate)
        myxpath = "//gate[@name=\""+my_gate+"\"]/xsl/@src"
        return @fence_doc.xpath(myxpath).to_s
    end

    def get_gate(my_gate)
        myxpath = "//gate[@name=\""+my_gate+"\"]/xsl/@src"
        return @fence_doc.xpath(myxpath).to_s
    end

end
</pre>
