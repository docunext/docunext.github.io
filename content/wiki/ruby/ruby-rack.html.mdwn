Ruby Rack is a web server written in [[Ruby]]. The cool thing about Rack is that it supports the idea of [[middleware]].

What good is middleware?

### [[Ruby]] Rack Middlware
* [[Rack Rewrite]]
* [[Rack-XSLView]]
* [[Rack Caching]]
* [[Rack Sessions]]
* [[Rack-Docunext-Content-Length]]

### Rack Test
Testing Rack applications has been an interesting activity for me. There are so many Ruby testing frameworks, it was tough for me to decide which one to use.

I'm now using:

* [[Rack-Test]]
* [[Webrat]]
* [[RSpec]]
* [[Rcov]]

### Frameworks Supporting Rack

* [[Camping]]
