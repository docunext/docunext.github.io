This is a good one... it helps keep dotfiles in-sync over multiple hosts by storing them in a [[Git]] repository.

### My Experience with Homesick
UPDATE: This [[gem]] is awesome!!

I have created two homesick repositories (one is a [[fork]]):

* http://github.com/docunext/vim_config
* http://github.com/docunext/docunext_dotfiles
