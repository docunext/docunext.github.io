Nice! A [[Ruby]] based static website compiler!

### Features

* Jekyll includes tasks to migrate from other blog engines - including [[Movable Type]], wow!
* Jekyll uses the [[Liquid]] template system.

### Benefits to Jekyll

* Thriving community!!
* Fast
* Lots of plugins
* Auto publishing
* Simple to use

All in all, I have to say that the coolest part of Jekyll I've experienced so far is how many great designers are using it. That makes a remarkable difference.

### My Experience with Jekyll

I'm finally using Jekyll. It took a while because there are so many choices for [[Static Website Compilers]]. I've previously used [[Ikiwiki]] and [[Chronicle]] since they were in [[Debian]]. These days, I'm much more focused on [[ruby]] than [[perl]], so its about time I switched. I've used [[git-wiki]] extensively, but that's different than Jekyll.

So far, I find Jekyll, a little awkward, but nice. Easy enough to use, but hard enough that I am learning. That is a sweet combination!
