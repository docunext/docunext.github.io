### Gem Locations

Trying to figure out how to use gems the right way. [[Ruby]] can't find my gems.

These were helpful too:
http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/6/in-case-you-re-having-trouble-installing-gems

In my case, I have two sets of rubygems installed. One from debian, and one in /usr/local/. Still not working right...

If I install a gem with [[Sudo]], they get installed to /var/lib/gems.

### Gem [[Hosting]]
There are a bunch of different places that host gems:

* RubyForge
* [[GemCutter]]

### [[Ruby Gems Directory]]

### Misc Notes
<pre class="sh_sh">
rake gemspec
gem build blah.gemspec
</pre>
