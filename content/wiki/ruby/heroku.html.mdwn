This appears to be what I always wanted from the [[Google]] app engine.

### Trying it Out
I'm trying to use it but I'm hung up trying to find the heroku binary... updatdb &
<pre class="sh_sh">
/var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/heroku-1.0.1/bin/heroku create
</pre>
... Also needed to:
<pre class="sh_sh">
apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
</pre>
Hmm, it uploaded my public key without my permission. It should not do that, though it might have happened as I accidentally ran the command in my home directory. Oops!

So it appears that this is for hosting [[Ruby on Rails]] applications. I wonder if other frameworks are supported? Yes:

<blockquote class="svxlb"><pre>
"Heroku supports Rack and Rack-based web frameworks like Sinatra, Merb, Ramaze, and Camping."
</pre></blockquote>

I think I'll try [[Camping]] as its caught my attention previously.

OK, finally got it to work. I had some trouble with camping, so I probably won't use that again, but I'm very impressed with Heroku. It really is what I wanted from the Google app engine! They even make setting up custom [[DNS]] records super easy. This is going to be big.

### Initial Thoughts
I am *very* impressed. Their documentation is excellent too. I'm a little confused though, the pricing goes from really free to pretty expensive very quickly.
