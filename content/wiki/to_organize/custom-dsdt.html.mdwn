I'm going to patch linux-source-2.6.21 to allow for custom [[DSDT]] settings.

### Kernel
Using [[debian]] makes compiling kernels easy.

<pre>
apt-get install kernel-package libncurses5-dev
</pre>

Since I'm going to be compiling it on my own, I'm disabling a lot of the modules I don't need. Debian does a great job of supporting lots of different folks' needs so that I don't have to! :-)

Once I ran the patch described here:

http://gaugusch.at/kernel.shtml

I ran "make menuconfig" and then "make-kpkg --initrd -rev Custom.1 kernel_image" as described here:
http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-kernel.en.html

### DSDT
<pre>
apt-get install iasl
cat /proc/acpi/dsdt > dsdt.dat
iasl -d dsdt.dat
</pre>

Then edit the DSDT as needed.

<pre>
iasl -tc dsdt.dsl
cp dsdt.aml /etc/initramfs-tools/DSDT.aml
</pre>
