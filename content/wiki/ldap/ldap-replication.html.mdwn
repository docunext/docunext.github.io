### OpenLDAP Replication on [[Debian]]

For setting up ldap replication on debian, I had to do this:
* add moduleload syncprov and:
<pre>
overlay syncprov
syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
syncprov-sessionlog 100
</pre>
to /etc/ldap/slapd.conf on the primary server
* add syncrepl section to the replicant:

<pre>
syncrepl rid=123
    provider=ldap://ldap.example.com:389
    type=refreshOnly
    interval=00:00:10:00
    searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
</pre>

The above was getting me the records, but was omitting the userPassword attributes, therefore I had to add binddn and credentials to the mix.  I had originally been using the [[LDAP]] admin user for replication, but now I'm using a new organizationalRole for this with read only access.

With [[Backsql]], the replication could be done via [[MySQL]].
