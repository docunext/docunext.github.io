I had a tough time finding documentation on how to setup [[GNU/Linux]] and [[LDAP]], but in the end its not too tough. I was making the mistake of trying to use [[DNS]] entries rather than [[ipHosts]].

### Configuration Files
I've got a few notes to share:

#### /etc/nsswitch.conf
<pre>
passwd:         files mysql ldap
group:          files mysql ldap
shadow:         files mysql ldap

hosts:          files dns ldap
networks:       files
</pre>

#### /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
<pre>
nss_base_hosts         ou=Hosts,dc=example,dc=com?one
</pre>

Test it out:
<pre>
getent hosts
</pre>

### Uses
Why did I want to setup LDAP to resolve simple hostnames? I wanted to do this to override public DNS records. I use [[pfSense]] and [[m0n0wall]] to setup [[VPN]]s, and services behind the firewalls are sometimes inhibited by the fact that public [[IP]] addresses won't resolve due to [[IP masquerading]].

I had originally setup several private [[DNS]] servers, but that proved to be a bit of a pain to manage.

### Alternatives
Now I'm actually using [[pdnsd]] for internal hostnames. I store the information in ldap, then convert it to text in /etc/hosts, and then share it with [[pdnsd]].
