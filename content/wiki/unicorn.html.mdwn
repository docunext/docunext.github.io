Unicorn is a [[Ruby]] powered [[web server]] based off of [[mongrel]]. I haven't reviewed the code, but apparently its makes intelligent use of [[UNIX]] concepts.

### My Experience with Unicorn
I haven't noticed too big of a difference, but I have noticed it starts up a lot faster than [[Thin]] or [[Webrick]].

When I try to run unicorn on [[FreeBSD]], I get this error:

<pre class="sh_sh">
Fatal error 'Exceeded maximum lock level' at line 1159 in file /usr/src/lib/libpthread/thread/thr_sig.c (errno = 0)
</pre>
