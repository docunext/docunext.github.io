### Packages
Some [[perl]] modules:
<pre>
apt-get install libmail-dkim-perl
apt-get install libmail-spf-query-perl spf-tools-perl
cpan Encode::Detect Mail::DomainKeys
</pre>

### Rules
After awhile, I had way too many rules. I uninstalled [[spamassassin]] and then installed it again. Thankfully that seemed to have cleaned out a lot of random rules!
