## VIA
The Via EDEN chips are embedded variants of the C3/C7 chips for use in thin clients and other low power, fanless installations.

### C3 Info

The C3 is a very capable processor with low power consumption. 

### C7 Info

* [[Via C7]] and C7-M : This is my favorite processor

Even though I'm a big fan of the C7, I'm nervous about how well the standard configuration supports CPU frequency scaling. I think I got it to work on my Everex laptop, but I'm having some trouble with my C7 desktop: 

<pre>
modprobe longhaul
longhaul: APIC detected. Longhaul is currently broken in this configuration.
</pre>

Don't use longhaul, use these instructions instead:

* <http://wiki.contribs.org/JetwayMiniITX>

Using Debian, I followed the instructions at contribs.org and using the latest testing kernel I did not apply any patches. I then followed these instructions: 

* <http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html>

for installing a custom kernel on a debian system.

### Via CN Info

The new Via chip is code named Isaiah, aka "CN". Its supposed to be really nice, though I have yet to see any products using it.

* [[VIA CN Isaiah]]

### AMD

* [[AMD/AMD Turion]]
* [[AMD/AMD Geode]]
* [[AMD/AMD Athlon]]

### Notes:
 
I've been tinkering around with the AMD Geode lately and I'm really impressed with this little guy. It is surprisingly effective for the amount of energy it consumes. Imagine: an x86 processor that only consumes 5 watts (or less) of power! 

Here are some computers which use the AMD Geode: 

* Soekris net4801
* PC Engines ALIX
* [[Dectop AMD PIC]]

### Intel

* [[Pentium M]]
* [[Intel Pentium SU2700]]
* [[Intel Core 2 Duo]]
* [[Intel Celeron D]]
* [[Intel Celeron 420]]
* [[Intel Celeron 215]]
* [[Intel Xeon L5410]]
* [[Intel® Pentium® Processor for Mobile T3400]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Mobile Processor T8100]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Mobile Processor P7450]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Mobile Processor P8400]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Mobile Processor P8600]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Processor T6400]]
* [[Intel® Core™2 Duo Processor T6600]]
* [[Intel Core i7]]
