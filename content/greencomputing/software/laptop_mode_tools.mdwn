Laptop Mode Tools is a great tool with a poor choice as a name. Why do I think its a bad name? Laptop mode tools can be used on desktop computers too, with the result of reducing heat and power consumption.

##What is Laptop Mode Tools?
Its a set of software utilities to allow a computer to enter "laptop mode", reducing power consumption and increasing battery lifetime. 

##Desktop Use

I edit /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf:
<pre>
# Enable laptop mode when on AC power.
ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC=1
</pre>
