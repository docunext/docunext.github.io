I first learned about Power Management through this website: 

* <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml>

It is a good overview of how everything works.

While focused on Thinkpads mostly, this page is also very helpful:

### Power Management on Computers running the Debian Universal Operating System 

On laptops and small service machines which run 24/7 I install:

<pre class="sh_sh">
apt-get install acpitool
</pre>

and I add this to /etc/rc.local
<pre class="sh_sh">
echo "/bin/echo 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "/bin/echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "hdparm -S 12 /dev/sda" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "modprobe acpi" >> /etc/rc.local
echo "echo 'ondemand' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor" >> /etc/rc.local
</pre>

### Powertop 
[[/Software/Powertop]] is a great utility for linux to get an idea of what is causing your processor to wakeup. It was written by Intel and takes advantage of newer features in their CPUs.

<pre class="sh_sh">
sudo apt-get install powertop
sudo powertop
</pre>

Powertop will display a "top" like scoreboard, identifying some processes which are chewing up energy, as well as suggest helpful ideas to reduce power consumption.
