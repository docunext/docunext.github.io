<h4>Just jotting down some random thoughts / ideas here</h4>
I think it might be possible! There is a <a href="http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jquerylisten.html">listener plugin</a>, which could log actions / events to a remote server. Playback would probably be best done with either Selenium or Windmill.

A proxy listener could also be setup with nanoserv or similar...

<h4>jQuery + Selenium</h4>
These two don't seem to get along too well, which is too bad.
