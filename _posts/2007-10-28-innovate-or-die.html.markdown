This is cool: Specialized, Google and YouTube are running a pedal-powered computer content:

<a href="http://www.innovate-or-die.com/">http://www.innovate-or-die.com/</a>

The website is rather nice, but they fail to mention that the idea is far from new. In the small amount of research I did in the past few years about this subject, I found several designs and working models of pedal power machines to leverage humans as a power source.
