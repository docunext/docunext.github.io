I'm trying out Mint 13 XFCE RC, and it looks really nice, but I'm stuck on the install, getting a json decode error.

I think it might it might be caused by a flaky internet connection, trying a workaround now.

Yup, that was it. I tried a USB wifi dongle and its working now.

The reason I'm using XFCE is because the machine is an old Everex laptop with a Via C7-M processor in it.

The display is nice, but its slooooow.

Uhhh, scratch that. It crashed halfway through. :-(

Trying one more time....
