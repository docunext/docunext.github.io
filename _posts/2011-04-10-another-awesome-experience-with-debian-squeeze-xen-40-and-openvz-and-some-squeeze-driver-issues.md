I am so utterly impressed with Debian. They are pushing the envelope - seriously!

The remarkable factor with Debian, Xen, and OpenVZ is simply that: the stable version of Debian supports a Xen 4.0 (a **very modern** impelementation) kernel, and with the help of pygrub, all different kernels can be used within the virtual machines.
