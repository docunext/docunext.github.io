      Thank you Albert!<br/>It worked for me. when I'm thinking back i remember that i saw this strange warning, something like "...in the future" when i were installing a package.<br/>And now it all makes sense! :)

My system time was all messed up. Installed ntpdate, synced, and error went away. :-)
