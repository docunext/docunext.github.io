VMWare for Macintosh OS X finally came out recently and I have to say I already like it. I'm definitely going to use this a lot. Also, Parallels 3 came out, but honestly I doubt I will upgrade simply because VMWare is free, and I think will continue to be free for the foreseeable future. Since I'll be able to use my VMs on multiple platforms, VMWare is better for my purposes.
