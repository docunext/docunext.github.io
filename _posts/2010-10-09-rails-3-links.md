Curious about using Warden, a Rack-based authentication mechanism, I searched for **Rails 3 Warden** and found these useful posts by Will:

* <http://willj.net/2010/07/11/fixing-the-warden-and-rails3-typeerror-cant-convert-nil-into-string-error/>
* <http://willj.net/2010/10/04/unicorn-and-bundler-issue/>

Its cool to see other people using Rails 3, Unicorn, and bundler.

I still have some hang ups about bundler I need to sort out, though.
