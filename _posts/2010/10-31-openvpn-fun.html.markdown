OpenVPN really is a terrific project. Its open source, its built on solid, tried and true components, and its very, very flexible.

Heck, it even works with Windows!

I'm helping my company get it in place, and while we're starting with it manually, I'd like to be able to distribute custom installers.

Why? Because as it turns out, Windows does require some minor hoop-jumping.

Other people have had this idea, too!
