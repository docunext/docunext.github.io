I used to be such an Apple fan, and believe it or not, it was the iPod and its eventually closed-nature which bothered me so much that I stopped buying Apple products.

I expected its successor, the [iPhone](http://www.docunext.com/blog/iphone.html), to be a total failure, but I was wrong - it was a smashing success.

Still, I am wary to purchase anything made by Apple, so when Google came out with Android, I was very interested.

It wasn't until the Droid X came along that I found the opportunity to buy an Android-powered device, and I'm glad I waited! Thankfully its on the Verizon Wireless network, and it has some very useful apps.

Frankly, I'm not sure why anyone would bother with an iPhone anymore!! The Droid X can even do one thing that any iPhone certainly cannot: be a 3G mobile hotspot. :-)

Sorry Apple and AT&T Wireless, the Droid X is the phone for me.
