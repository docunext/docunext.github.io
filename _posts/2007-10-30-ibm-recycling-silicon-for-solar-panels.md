This is awesome news! IBM has figured out a way to recycle silicon from old or unused computer chips and turn them into solar panels, at least that's how I understand it. Its pretty amazing how silicon can be used for such a wide variety or purposes. For instance, <a href="http://www.hungryblogger.com/blog/2007/10/19/silicone-safe-to-cook-with/">silicon can even be used for cookware</a>.

I read this news at Computerworld, and in the article, they state that the development is currently in use at an IBM facility in Burlington, Vermont. Where else? :-)
