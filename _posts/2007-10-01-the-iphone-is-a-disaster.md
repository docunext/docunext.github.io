The iPhone is a complete disaster, in my opinion. From the phone being hyped up, to it being too slippery to hold, to the keypad not working well, to a $200 price drop within the first few months of release, to it getting bricked by Apple's updates, the iPhone is not the raving success of its predecessor, the iPod. My feelings towards Apple have been turning more sour recently, and I'm very close to using linux or FreeBSD on my desktop. I'll hang on to my Macbook for now no matter what.

Here's an interesting post at <a href="http://informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/09/iphone_users_ta.html" rel="nofollow">InformationWeek about a potential iPhone class action lawsuit</a>.
