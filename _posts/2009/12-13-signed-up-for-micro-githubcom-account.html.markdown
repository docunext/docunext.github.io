I've been using the free version of github.com (restricted to open source licensed materials) for a couple months now, and over the past few weeks I've started to use it a whole bunch more.

Tonight I decided to sign up for the micro plan for some convenient and private revision control and backup.

The micro plan only gives you five repositories, but that's fine for only $7 / month!
