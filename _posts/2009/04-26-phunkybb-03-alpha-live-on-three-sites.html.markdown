The pending release of PhunkyBB 0.3 alpha is alive and well on three websites! This has been an enjoyable release process to work on, and its not done yet.

I keep feeling the urge to update all the installs of PhunkyBB, but I want to give these sites a few weeks of operation to find and iron out any last minute wrinkles.

Here's some links to the sites hosting PhunkyBB 0.3, if you want to check it out. The changes may seem minor, but look close, the upgrade is substantial:
