This is wonderful news: the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution is now official. I've been very impressed with this port for quite some time now and am very pleased to see it available in all the debian repositories.

Congratulations to all the debian people on another huge step forward!

If you want to help out, there is a <a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/TODO">TODO file for the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port here</a>.
