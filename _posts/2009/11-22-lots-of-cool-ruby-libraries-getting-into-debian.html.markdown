I just happened to notice that Sinatra has made it into Debian - awesome!

Looks like Merb is about there too:

<pre class="sh_sh">
libextlib-ruby1.8 - General Ruby 1.8 class extensions for DataMapper and Merb
libextlib-ruby1.9 - General Ruby 1.9 class extensions for DataMapper and Merb
libextlib-ruby - General Ruby class extensions for DataMapper and Merb
</pre>

Thin is there, Rack is there, Ramaze, Camping, and Mongrel too. No Unicorn yet, but I expect it soon.

I'm curious about Spec and Nora... so many to choose from!

TODO:

* Improve gem / Debian configurations
* Improve ruby 1.9 support
