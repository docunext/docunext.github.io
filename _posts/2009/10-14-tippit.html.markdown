      They're spamming me also.  I never signed up for their trash.  They're spammers, pure and simple.

Tippit has been sending me several technology related marketing emails per day the past several days.

I never signed up for any newsletters with them, so I sent them this:

<blockquote>
Remove me from any and all of your email lists! Do not share my information with anyone.

You have been sending me way too many emails. Stop it!
</blockquote>
