It got me at the first line:

"iDon't allow open development."

This is a commercial for a new phone called the Droid.

UPDATE: Apparently the Droid is a new phone powered by Android from Google. Its going to be on the Verizon Network which is totally ironic, because Verizon Wireless has a terrible track record for openness. They actually had a phone which was fairly open, and changed the operating system to force customers to have to use their network to download pictures!
