In my quest to find all the open source technical drawing software packages out there, today I came across Xfig.

Its very simple, and in my opinion, that's a good thing! There are also a bunch of supporting software packages, like fig2ps, and transfig. With the latter, I was able to convert a fig drawing to a pdf file. The output was very nice!
