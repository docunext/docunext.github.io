Now this is some cool news... kernel.org now hosts the ability to boot computers over the internet!

<http://boot.kernel.org/>

I am very interested to try this out. If I understand correctly, I download a 56kb image file (gpxe.usb), flash it to a USB drive, and then boot. When the computer boots, it only starts up enough services to download a complete operating system from the boot.kernel.org site.

Operating system choices include:

* Debian : Debian live
* Ubuntu : 9.04
* Damm Small Linux : Lightweight linux distribution with GUI.
* Knoppix : Knoppix 5.0.1 English.
