Grrrr! I wish Gnash and YouTube played well together. This is what I get when I try to view a YouTube video with Gnash in Iceweasel on Debian:


I've read that there are workarounds to get Gnash and YouTube to play nicely, but I haven't bothered. I had a binary blob Flash plugin for awhile - it was the alpha version for x86_64 linux, but apparently there was a security issue with it, and the x86_64 alpha has been discontinued and is no longer available. Ugh!

It seems so preposterous that Adobe is floundering with Flash where Macromedia made mega waves and had incredible penetration - I heard their plug-in was installed in over 90% of all browsers.

In my opinion, Adobe needs to really open up Flash. Macromedia sort of did it, but then pulled back. Flash has lost a lot of its luster in recent years, and they really need to do something to save it. Besides the fact that Apple refuses to support it on the iphone, javascript and CSS are catching up in terms of engaging, rich media, and obviously those are open technologies / standards.

With HTML5 on the horizon, Adobe needs to act fast. The open source community has already done so much for and with the SWF format, its time for Adobe to step up to the plate and open up the format!

At least this error page on YouTube is a little more informative:


Ooh! This one is even better:
