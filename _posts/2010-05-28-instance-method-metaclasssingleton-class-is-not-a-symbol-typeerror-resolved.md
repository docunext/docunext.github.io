      I ran into this same error, but unfortunately your workaround didn't work for me (one of my gems required activesupport >= 2.3.6).  I solved this by commenting out line 13 of activesupport-2.3.6/lib/active_support/core_ext/object/metaclass.rb:<br/><pre>#deprecate :metaclass => :singleton_class</pre>)

I got this error today when trying to run a Sinatra web application. Not sure what the root of the problem is, but I found a workaround:

<pre class="sh_sh">
sudo gem1.9.1 install activesupport --version 2.3.5
</pre>
<pre class="sh_sh">
$ sudo gem uninstall activesupport
Select gem to uninstall:
 1. activesupport-2.3.5
 2. activesupport-2.3.8
 3. All versions
> 2
</pre>

For reference, the full error:

<pre class="sh_sh">
