PC Engines has announced the successor to their popular WRAP (wireless router application platform) board: the ALIX.

The ALIX comes in three configurations, those familiar will recognize the ALIX2 variations, but the ALIX1 is new and <em>very</em> interesting.

It is a mini-itx thin client board, including 256MB of ram, VGA output, 1 ethernet connector, and the best part: it only uses <strong>5 watts of power</strong>! For expandability, it also has a PCI slot as well as a mini-pci slot, which many people use for wireless connectivity in both the WRAP boards and the Soekris boards.

I've already pre-ordered an ALIX1c, and am eagerly waiting its shipment. I also plan to order some of the other boards to support our growing networks.

The ALIX uses the VT6105M "Via Rhine" chipset. I'm interested to see how well it performs.

#### <strong>ALIX versus DecTop</strong>

The ALIX could be compared to the DecTop in some regards, each has some pros and cons. The ALIX has an on-board NIC, the dectop is cheaper and includes a hard drive. The ALIX is faster, the dectop has upgradeable RAM. The ALIX is RoHS, the dectop is not. The dectop includes a case, the ALIX is a common form factor - mini-itx. The ALIX also includes a mini-pci slot for wireless nixs.

For surfing the web, the DecTop is a good choice in my opinion - it even includes a keyboard and mouse. If you are looking for a network appliance, the ALIX is a better choice.
