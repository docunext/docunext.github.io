I just disassembled an old Toshiba Satellite 5205-S703 and am planning to remove the Pentium M socket 479 from it to use in a mini-itx processor.

I'm a little hesitant to use a processor that's been used for a couple of years though - they probably don't have too long of a shelf life. Alternatively, I may end up using the laptop (which I just re-assembled) as an LTSP client.
