title: Asterisk PBX Update
date: 2007-03-07

The time has come for me to upgrade my Asterisk PBX hardware and configuration. Currently, our local area network server is a "swiss army knife" of services: file sharing, routing (nat), pbx, and im. While I thought this might be efficient, it is not. So I'm trying a different route, installing each component on separate hardware.
<h3>Asterisk PBX Hardware</h3>

The <a href="http://metrix.net/metrix-pbx-i-kit-p-15.html">Metrix PBX I Kit</a> looked pretty good, but upon further consideration, I need more performance capabilities.

Then there is the MSI Axis 700 for $179 at Newegg.com, or the ASUS Terminator T1 for $74 at Newegg.com. Since I won't have serious voip volume, I'm going to go with the lower priced Terminator T1. Plus, I think I have RAM for it already! To keep the power consumption as low as possible, I'm planning to use a 2gb compact flash card instead of a hard drive. I also bought a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813153052"> JetWay J7F3E-PB Socket A (Socket 462) SiS 741CX Mini ITX AMD Motherboard</a> for another server, not sure what yet!
<h3>Asterisk PBX Software</h3>

The beauty of Asterisk is that it is licensed under the GPL, so it has plenty of variations and distributions: <b>AstLinux</b>

Freepbx looks great because I can run it on ubuntu, my distro of choice. Other than that, I choose Debian.
