Yay! Mod_auth_mysql is back in action in debian!

I've previously used mod_auth_mysql before etch, but have since stopped after upgrading held back so much. I was able to switch to mod_auth_pam and pam_mysql, but I wasn't too crazy about that.

Hopefully Apache's mod_dbd in Debian will soon ship with the mysql driver. The licensing issues have been placated, but the code is still MIA. :-(
