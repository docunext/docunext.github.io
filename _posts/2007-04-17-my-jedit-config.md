I love jEdit, and here's a few things I found useful: * Saving & Backup: Set backup to on, but to a different directory, # prefix and suffix, save every 60 seconds, max 5 * Status Bar: Turn all off except: Show status bar, show overwrite status, and memory* General: default char encoding = UTF-8* Docking: file system browser to the left* Editing: soft wrap and tabs* Encodings: all off except UTF-8* Gutter: All on* Text Area: Monaco 11, anti-aliased text* Tool bar: do not show* View: show buffer switcher

File System Browser Settings:* Hide tool bar* Hide icons* Hide hidden files* Show Menu Bar (favorites are REALLY useful!)
