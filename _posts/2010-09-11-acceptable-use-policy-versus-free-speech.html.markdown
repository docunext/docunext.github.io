News that Rackspace has discontinued hosting the website of the church of the pastor who had planned to [burn the Qu'ran](http://www.sickofthenews.com/blog/2010/09/dont-burn-the-quran.html) is getting some backlash about freedom of speech.

The Rackspace acceptable use policy apparently states that customers cannot use their service to "[promote or incite violence]". While I personally feel the pastor's idea is a very bad one, I don't think he intended in to incite violence, though I would be surprised if it didn't.

This raises the question about whether willful ignorance of crime or intent amount to the same thing. Looks like it is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia states that courts usually state that defendants should know what their actions involve</a>.

And as far as I know, inciting violence is not just against the acceptable use for Rackspace services, its also against the law!
