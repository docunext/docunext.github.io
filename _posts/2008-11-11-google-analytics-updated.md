I just logged into Google Analytics and SURPRISE! they updated the interface. At first I really liked it, but then I realized that there are still a bunch of <a href="http://www.informedusability.com/blog/">user interface usability issue</a>s - like that the number of rows displayed is never remembered.

The major difference I noticed is the ability to view percentage changes over the past day, week, month or year for several sites at once. That makes it easier to get a quick glance of what's going on.

I don't mean to complain - I love Google Analytics. Its pretty amazing that it is available free of charge for low-volume sites. I eventually would like to host my own version of this type of service so that I can retain and further analyze the data, but I just don't have the time to set that up at the moment.
