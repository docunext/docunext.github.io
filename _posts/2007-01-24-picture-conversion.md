One of my clients have a ton of photographs in TIFF format that need to be made "web ready". The strategy I'm taking is to use imagemagick to convert and compress the images into JPEG format, and then clean up the file names with detox. So far its working well.

Next I'll need to find a way to automate the uploading and database entry of the filenames, while correlating them with the subjects in the photographs. Challenging yet fun stuff!
