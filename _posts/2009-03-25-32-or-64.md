I have to say that it is indeed tempting from time to time to switch back to 32-bit. Occasionally I find programs which run only on 32-bit: flash, squirrelfish, and chromium.

But I'm sticking with 64 bit as much as I can. I will obviously continue to use 32 bit on machines that don't support 64! That includes some of my development machines, a backup notebook, a netbook, and my pfSense firewalls.
