      Rock and roll!<br/><br/>BTW, although I have no complaints performance wise with my setup, Accelerated encryption sounds like an interesting change, I will look into that.

      I'm only using it because the processor I'm running on is pretty slow for a desktop - the Via C7 - well actually it isn't that slow it just has a pretty small cache so it can feel slow. To combat that I'm doing everything I can to increase performance. I just fixed the font renderings in it and it feels much faster. :-)

      Also from a performance perspective, my only complaint is that I shut down more often - until I can figure out how to get libsplashy setup to ask for a password when waking up. I wonder if I can shutdown after three failures?

Well I finally did it - I took the encryption challenge! I followed Zeth's instructions to encrypt my home directory:

<a href="http://commandline.org.uk/linux/encrypt-your-home-directory-part-two-2007-12-09-01-00.html?showcomments=yes" rel="nofollow">Encrypt your /home</a>

I made a change to use the basic aes driver, which on my machine uses the aes-padlock for accelerated encryption. So far so good!
