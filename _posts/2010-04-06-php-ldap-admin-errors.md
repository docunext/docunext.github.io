I'm trying to login to my phpldapadmin installation but I'm getting these errors:

<pre class="sh_sh">
E_STRICT: Declaration of AJAXTree::draw_dn() should be compatible with that of PLMTree::draw_dn()
</pre>

and

<pre class="sh_sh">
error (a:5:{i:0;s:97:"E_STRICT: Declaration of AJAXTree::...&lt;TRUNCATED>)
</pre>

I'm uninstalling it and reinstalling it... that of course didn't help. This did:

* <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/phpldapadmin/+bug/446669>

which points to this diff for /usr/share/phpldapadmin/lib/AJAXTree.php:

* <http://launchpadlibrarian.net/33321446/phpldapadmin.diff>

<pre class="sh_diff">

<       protected function draw_dn($dn,$level=0,$first_child=true,$last_child=true) {

>       protected function draw_dn($dn,$level,$first_child=true,$last_child=true) {
</pre>
