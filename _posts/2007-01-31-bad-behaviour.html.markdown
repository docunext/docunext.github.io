Trying out the Bad Behaviour plugin from ioerror:

<a href="http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/">http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/</a>

This works well, but I did run into one problem <a href="http://www.trisweb.com/archives/2007/03/17/wordpress-wp-cronphp-and-bad-behavior-apache-crash/">wp-cron.php and bad behaviour not getting along</a>.

But, as I commented there:

<blockquote>

Oh wait – you can just add you ip to the whitelist.php in the bad-behavior folder. Cool.</blockquote>
