This is good news:

<a href="http://www.philkern.de/weblog/en/debian/etch_4.0r4.html">Stable Point Release: Etch 4.0r4 (aka etchnhalf) </a>

I'd like to start keeping my production servers running stable software as long as possible, however the recent development in <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/">power saving</a> have got me immediately dist-upgrading to lenny. Etch and a half provides a newer kernel, and the same stable packages. The SSL bug was also fixed, thank goodness.
