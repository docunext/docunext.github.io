I'm busy setting up a server room and decided to take some pictures of the racks and machines setup for high availablity NAS. It's a work in progress, but definitely coming along:


Here we see the two high availability NAS machines I built recently.


Here they are again, and you can see the HA web servers in the top left (yes they are notebooks!).


And here we connect to the cloud. :-)
