title: Perl and Python Old Pals

I'm finding many similarities between perl and python, though I'm sure there are as many, if not more, differences.

I've been using PHP for so long, its hard to break out. I've *lightly* used perl for a couple of years, and only recently sat down and read a book about python. I liked it, but couldn't find time to use it enough to get some traction. I wrote a couple of scripts, started but have yet to finish using a project with it. WSGI really caught my attention before I got distracted by something else.

My recent foray with perl and mod_perl has reminded me a lot of the book I read on python, and the stuff I learned about WSGI. I kind of feel like the relationship between perl and apache bridged by mod_perl is similar to the relationship between WSGI apps, middleware and servers - that is very cool!
