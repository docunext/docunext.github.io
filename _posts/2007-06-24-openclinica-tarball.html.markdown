If you are looking for the OpenClinica tarball, you can download it here. They require you to register even though it is open source software, licensed under the LGPL. If you just want to view the source, here it is:

<del>OpenClinica-2.0.tar.gz</del>

You can also register and download the source from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.openclinica.org/">OpenClinia.org</a>. A cursory glance makes me feel like they understand research very well, but have over-engineered this software package. Perhaps I go overboard with simplicity from time to time, but better to err in that direction.

Some info about the project:

UPDATE November 2007: File removed to conserve space.
