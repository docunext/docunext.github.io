I'd like to migrate Spamassassin stuff to mysql, including:

* user settings
* beyesian data
* automatic white lists

Its almost time to switch over to <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/03/trying-out-check_policy_service-inet1270012525.html">postfix-gld</a> as well. I've had it running on a backup mx for awhile and so far, so good. I did run into a couple of small issues, but nothing huge.
