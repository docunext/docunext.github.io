title: Vista and Power Management

I use Vista as my entertainment center for two reasons:

<ul><li>Netflix supports it for their watch it now service</li><li>I have a laptop with a broken screen that I came with Vista on it
</li></ul> Since I don't really use it for anything other than watching TV, it doesn't cause me too many problems.

One continuous annoyance remains, however. Whenever I run media player or Internet Explorer, the power management settings change to have the machine go to sleep after five hours.

No matter how many times I've changed the settings back. It still happens.

Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
