      Do you use the CC on any other sites? Bank of America offers a virtual credit card service that seems to be very good. I'd almost like to get a new card issued and only use the virtual numbers.<br/><br/>I'd almost prefer my credit card processor was in the Netherlands than NYC, USA. :)

      Hi Jay! Happy New Year! It might be safer in the Netherlands, but I've had a few credit card companies flag foreign and overseas transactions as fraudulent, just because the transaction wasn't done in the US. Go figure.

I'm again canceling my O'Reilly Safari account. The <a href="http://www.informedbanking.com/blog/2008/01/01/my-american-express-simplycash-card-compromised.html">credit card I use there was compromised</a>, and though I have no idea how it was compromised, I don't want to bother having to update all my preferences.

I left this note as the reason for my cancellation:

<blockquote>The credit card I used here was compromised, and I'm concerned about how the information was obtained. The fact that your cc processor is in the Netherlands, labeled as BEBIT doesn't help. </blockquote>
