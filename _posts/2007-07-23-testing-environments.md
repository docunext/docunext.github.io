When testing, it really helps to have an isolated testing environment to conduct the tests. This may seems obvious, but I constantly find myself testing development, demonstration, and even production systems from time to time. That's why I'm taking the time today to set up a dedicated server for our testing purposes. Granted, it is a 400Mhz Via Eden thin client, but it should do the trick. :-)
