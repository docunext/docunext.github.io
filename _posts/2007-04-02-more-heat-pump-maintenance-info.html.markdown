title: More Heat Pump Maintenance Notes

My neighbor stopped by to mention my heat pump had frost on it, and that the unit might be low on freon. I just checked some web pages I found during my last <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/03/17/hvac-heat-pump-maintenance/">heat pump research session</a>, and one in particular (<a href="http://www.hannabery.com/hp101_2.shtml">Heat pumps 101</a>) mentions that frost is normal for a heat pump, and it will defrost itself if necessary.

I don't have time today but I'm going to evaluate Pann and Building Automation for heat pump inspections over the next month or so.
