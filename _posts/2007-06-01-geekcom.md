Geek.com is running an article about VIA's chipset business that I found interesting:

<a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2007May/bch20070601005710.htm" rel="nofollow">VIA may be spinning off chipset business</a>

I also like VIA C3's and C7's, but the 2GB ram limitation is annoying. Web servers need a lot of ram, but not much processor power, especially for static content. I think the new 800 FSB chipset has a 4GB RAM limit, which is better.
