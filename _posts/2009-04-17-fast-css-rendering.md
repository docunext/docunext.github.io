title: Fast CSS Rendering

One thing that really amazed me about PunBB was how fast it is. It is also one of the reasons why I chose it as a conceptual starting point for developing <a href="http://www.phunkybb.com/blog/">PhunkyBB</a>.

I've wondering for some time how it achieved its speed, especially since it does use a lot of div and table tags, as well as a substantial amount of CSS.

A moment ago I was editing some CSS for <a href="http://www.phunkybb.com/blog/">PhunkyBB</a> and it dawned on me that the speed may be due to how specific the CSS rules are. I'll have to do some research and testing to validate this assumtion.
