BeleniX works right out of the box on the <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/01/350-laptop-arrived/">$350 laptop</a> I bought last year. I haven't installed it yet - just running the live CD so far. At least the graphics worked, I wasn't able to get 1280x800 on the Everex for some reason.

Doesn't look like it was able to auto-detect the wireless card either, but that's OK.
