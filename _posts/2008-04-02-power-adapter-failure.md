One of my newer server's uses a small picoPSU power supply and an external power adapter for its power. Unfortunately, yesterday the adapter failed.

I use this setup as it is more energy efficient than all of the other power supply setups I have tried. Eventually I would like to use a single 12V power source for multiple computers but I have yet to find a good solution for that.
