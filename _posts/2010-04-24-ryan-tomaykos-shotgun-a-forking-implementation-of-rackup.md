Thanks to Nesta, I found out about Shotgun - a Ruby library used for running Rack applications and middleware.

Its works good, but I prefer using Unicorn. I'll probably use it when I don't have access to Unicorn.

Shotgun was written and is maintained by Ryan Tomayko, who coincidentally wrote an article about Unicorn which is where I found out about it.
