Grr, I spent a bunch of time trying to compile the Moschip7703 driver and eventually did, but the darn usb to serial device I have simply won't work. Guess I'll get some more rosewill usb-serial connectors, they work in my experience.

I gave up on this and the rosewill adapters arrived yesterday, still a little finicky, but I did get one to work.
