title: Testing Again
date: 2008-12-06

Today I'm spending a few hours testing an application I haven't tested in a few months, and its glaringly obvious that its been too long.

Since I waited so long between testing sessions, a lot has changed in the application, and many of the tests are failing, but not because there is a problem with the application.

Recalling back, I think I may have postponed testing because there were many changes on the horizon, and I wanted to wait to test until some things had settled down.

Not is that time, and I'm going to have to go through and make a ton of changes to the testing suite and test scripts. Not a big deal, just monotonous.

UPDATE: I've been making my way through the tests, and although a lot of the errors were on the part of the tests, I did find one bug with the program. That makes it all worthwhile.
