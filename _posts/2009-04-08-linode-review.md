      Glad you are enjoying the service and thanks for the writeup!  The removal of the eth1 interface was necessary mostly because of how Xen was handling it, although there were some other advantages.  Feel free to open a support ticket if you need more information.

Its been over a year since I first signed on with Linode, and I figure its time for a quick review.

My overall experience has been very positive. I have increased my account to include an extra 100GB of traffic per month as well as an additional IP address (for a maximum of two).

The only problem I had, and it was a very minor problem, was the change from eth1 to eth0:1 for my private IP address. It only took a moment to change, but still it doesn't seem like it was necessary.

If you are thinking of trying out Linode, I hope you find my review helpful. Let me know if you have any questions. Note - I have no affiliation with Linode other than being a customer.
