Simple Defects, the distributed issue tracking system written in Perl with hooks into Git, has been on my radar screen for awhile. I've installed it and run a few tests and it worked well, but I just don't have the familiarity I want to have with Perl yet.

I started to look around for a Ruby-based equivalent to SD and found [this article by Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org/blog/2010/04/26).

I haven't fully tested it out yet, but it sounds terrific. Its open source, and the code is available at Gitorious:

* <http://gitorious.org/ditz>
* <http://github.com/docunext/ditz>

Its a Ruby forge project too:

* <http://ditz.rubyforge.org/>

More pages about ditz:

Hmm... I've run into a little trouble with ditz:

<pre class="sh_sh">
multiple assignment in conditional (SyntaxError)
</pre>

I've forked it and might have fixed the issues.... DOH!

<pre class="sh_sh">
/home/albertlash/src/docu-ditz/lib/ditz.rb:71:in `run_pager': uninitialized constant PLATFORM (NameError)
</pre>

It has to do with WIN32 so I just deleted it, but actually I'll comment it out. Yup, looks like its working OK now....

[Tracker](http://tracker.rubyforge.org/) looks nice too!

Looking around at ditz some more I see its actually quite an interesting little package. It uses yaml for marshalling / serializing the issue objects in the git repository. With respect to Git, I really like the idea of [using flat files for storage](http://www.docunext.com/blog/2010/01/lets-use-flat-files-for-storage.html), and even combining files to keep management simpler. With a command line parser / interface, it totally makes sense.

But why YAML? Personally I would have preferred XML or JSON, but not a problem - it might even be possible to change which serialization method it uses.

Ooooh - there is a fresher fork of ditz stuff (and patches too):

* <http://github.com/ohac/ditz>
* <http://github.com/ohac/ditz-patches>

Looks like there might even be a sinatra app in there!

Another good reason I like JSON:

CONCLUSION: I think Ditz just might be the direction I want to go!
