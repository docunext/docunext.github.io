I've got a few hours to work on something good... should it be WebDAV + SVN integration with Ikiwiki, or upgrading my Varnish installs?

Truthfully, even though I want to upgrade ASAP, I think the Varnish installs should wait a few more weeks. I've been tweaking some settings and want to see what effect they have before I go changing anything.

So WebDAV + SVN + Ikiwiki integration it is. I'm planning on hooking up <a href="http://www.established-sites.com/blog/">Established Sites</a> to this somehow too; maybe even tying in MovableType!
