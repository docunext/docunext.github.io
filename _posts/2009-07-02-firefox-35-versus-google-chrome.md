title: Firefox 3.5 versus Google Chrome

Google Chrome on linux is surprisingly nice and fast, but there are still a couple bugs which are preventing me from using it full time.

I'm eager to try out Firefox 3.5, but its not yet available in the Debian repositories.

It will probably work it out like this: Iceweasel (Firefox) 3.5 will be available right when Google Chrome starts working perfectly!
