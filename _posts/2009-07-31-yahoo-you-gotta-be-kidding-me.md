This post isn't about Yahoo's deal with Microsoft. Its about how I transferred a domain I had setup with Yahoo to GoDaddy, but Yahoo was still trying to charge me $35 / year - FOR NOTHING!

That is unethical in my opinion. I just canceled the service and put this in the comment text area:

<blockquote>You are unethical. I transferred this domain to another registrar and yet you did not cancel my service. That is absurd.</blockquote>
