A relative of mine recently informed me that he found an antivirus software supplier he likes. They are called Avast, and he said their package is doing the job. They have a free version for non-commercial use, but to continue using it after sixty days, users must register.

They also have a professional version which costs $39.99 for one year, as well as a small business suite.
