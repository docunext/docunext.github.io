After working with the new Flash 8 bitmap API, I've been thinking a lot about computer graphics again. Always a favorite topic of mine, computer graphics are surfacing again as a great business opportunity. There are many free online image hosts such as picasa and flickr, photography communities such as photo.net, and even video hosts such as youtube, and my guess is that the next step will be putting more tools for these images online. I did a quick search and found some good sites:
