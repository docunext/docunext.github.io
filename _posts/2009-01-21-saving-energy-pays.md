Just got my office energy bill from last month: $160!!! Ouch!

Usually my energy bills are around $100 or less, and this one was much higher because I've had more computers on 24/7. I've been doing a lot of migrating of things around, and since one of my networks is pretty slow, its been taking a long time. Thankfully the new network will be much faster, and it has computers that are more energy efficient on it.

I'm aiming to keep the electricity bills under $100 if possible.
