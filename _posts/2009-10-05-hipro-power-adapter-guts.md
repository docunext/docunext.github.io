Another one of my "energy efficient" power adapters died. I got curious so I broke this one open. It wasn't worth it though, there was no obvious indication of why it stopped working and raw electronics can be very dangerous. HIPRO makes their plastic boxes extremely difficult to open, too, which is actually a great idea in my humble opinion.
