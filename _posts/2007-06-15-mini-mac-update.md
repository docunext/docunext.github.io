      Some of the programs that were transferred were compiled for PowerPC and are getting translated via "Rosetta" to run on Intel "x86" architecture. You can download intel optimized versions of Camino, jEdit, NeoOffice, and more. They will run a lot faster!

I've been trying to use the Migration Assistant to get all my data from my old machine onto the mini mac. I keep running into the same problem. I follow the instructions hold down the "T" key while you restart to connect the machines via firewire, but the old machine just shuts down when I do this.

In searching for answers I found the following info on the mac website:

<blockquote class="svxlb"><pre>
Make sure the target computer has an ATA hard drive on ATA bus 0. It is normal for a target computer to shut down if it does not detect an ATA hard drive on ATA bus 0.
</pre></blockquote>

Gonna have to open up the old machine to make this work. I'll report the results shortly.

Well we opened up the machine. Al had to use jumpers to make it work, but it did work.

Took about 45 minutes to transfer all the data between the two machines, but now I'm operating on the mini, just like there was no transition.

Thus far the only really noticeable difference in performance is that the mini is silent.
