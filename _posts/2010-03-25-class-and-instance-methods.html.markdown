I love the concepts behind object oriented programming, and in my experience Ruby is taking it to another level!

I'm reading up on object and instance methods and I found this helpful page:

* [Class and Instance Methods in Ruby](http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/11/class-and-instance-methods-in-ruby/)

I'm going to do some more exercises on this topic, including accessors, modules, and the concept of self, so stay tuned! I'm also going to investigate what parts of class and instance methods, if any, have changed in Ruby 1.9.

This is helpful too:
