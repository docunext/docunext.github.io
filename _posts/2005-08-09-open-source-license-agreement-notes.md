Just my notes, not reliable interpretations.
<h3>GPL</h3>

Seems to me like version 2 can be used without problem in ASPs, as long as the code, binary and/or source, is not distributed. Word has it that version 3 will change that. So watch out!

There is also an interpretation about derivative works, and a program that is merely aggregated is not a derivative is not covered by the GPL.
<h3>LGPL</h3>

This is not problematic. You are able to incorporate LGPL code into another application and distribute that application without releasing the other application under the GPL.
<h3>BSD</h3>

Everyone seems to think this application is good.
<h3>Apache</h3>

No problem
<h3>PHP</h3>

No problem so far, if they change the license, you can always use an existing version.
