I continue to have some problems with NFS on linux over wireless and an IPSec VPN.

To try and fix it, I've tried a bunch of variations with my fstab settings. Now I'm trying a pfSense setting:

Interfaces -> OPT1 -> Wireless Configuration: "Enable WME"

So far, so good. I'm going to run this for awhile.
