I'm currently installing Cygwin on an Everex laptop that's running Windows XP.  Cygwin is a command line that allows the user greater control over the PC and the way it functions.  I have been unsuccessful in installing Cygwin as it keeps crashing during the installation.  Not sure what the problem is.
