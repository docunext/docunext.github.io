I'm very interested in trying out Google Wave, but I'm a little late in requesting an invitation!

I finally did so and gave the Google Wave team a "hello everybody, so glad to see you" greeting, a la Music Together. :-)

Hopefully I'll get an invite by the weekend as I'll have an hour or two to try it out.
