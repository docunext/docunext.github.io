I keep trying to not use the word slave when referring to MySQL replication. I always tried to use replicant instead, but it is an obtuse word.

Why not use clone? It actually is more accurate, and instead of master, use origin or something similar. I have less of an issue with master than I do with slave.

What do you think, should we ask MySQL to change the name?
