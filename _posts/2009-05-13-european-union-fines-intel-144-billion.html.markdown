I wish I knew what this intel storefront was all about. I saw in during a recent visit to <a href="http://www.la-notes.com/blog/">Los Angeles, California</a>.

I'm surprised that the EU fine against intel was so large - especially since it wasn't as large as the Microsoft fine. Based upon the negative experiences I have had with the Windows operating system and various Microsoft products, I got the impression that they were allocating their efforts towards eliminating competition by any means necessary.

For some reason, Microsoft doesn't seem to have any competition, while AMD is at least still in the ring with intel.
