I've come to use Github.com on a daily basis in a lot of what I've been working on.

Now? Their website and services have been down for about 15 minutes. Doh!

The website is back online, but is reporting that it is temporarily offline.

Storage server temporarily offline. Please try again in a few minutes or contact GitHub.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

Back online, yay!

According to the Github twitter feed, the problem involved a heartbeat monitor which was incorrectly marking back-end machines as down.
