Rel anchor attribute nofollow value is a strategy to reduce comment spam, and the sometimes disastrous effect it can have on search engine result positioning (SERPS).

Nowadays, why would anyone ever <strong>NOT</strong> use rel="nofollow"? I like Wikipedia's feeling's towards the issue, but what other websites are that altruistic?
