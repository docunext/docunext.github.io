Franklin crashed tonight with a Memory Check Exception error, so I was unable to do a remote reboot and had to travel into Cambridge to reset the machine.


I'm really curious about what caused this error. :-(

While I was at Level3, I tried to make the best of my time there and installed a vz kernel (successful), restarted the vpn gateway (I had accidentally shutdown the vpn machine a few weeks ago - no big deal, but inconvenient) as well as setup a VLAN on the cisco switch to separate the private network with the public ips.
