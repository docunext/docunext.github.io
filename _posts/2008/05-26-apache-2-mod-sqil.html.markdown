<div>This is wicked cool!! I just found out about <a href="http://www.heute-morgen.de/modules/mod_sqil/">mod_sqil</a>, and mentioned it at the <a href="http://www.nexista.org/blog/">Nexista blog</a> a few minutes ago, and then got it working on bart. So awesome.</div>

What is it? Its a lightweight RDBMS to XML mapper. Since it uses Apache, mod dbd, and other modules by <a href="http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/category/database/">Niq Kew</a>, its fast. :-)
