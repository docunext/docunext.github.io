Outoforder.cc's mod_sql_mysql is a great idea - unfortunately the debian package only wants prefork. I tried it out anyway - work well, but I prefer the worker mpm for production sites.

Hopefully the future will bring better support for logging to SQL. As a model, I think they've done a terrific job of tying everything together.
