I'm juggling some web services, so I've again signed up for Slicehost. My previous experience with them was quite positive, so when decided to get another VPS, I decided to choose them.

I'm using Debian Lenny, though the VPS started with Etch. I was totally pleased with how quickly it was setup, though when I tried signing up, they still had my old account linked to my email, so I had to use a different email address. No biggy.
