ICANN just emailed me their yearly whois check-up, reminding me of a domain I own but forgot about. I had registered the domain via dot5hosting. To transfer the domain, I emailed dot5:

<blockquote>
I would like to transfer ischemic.org to another registrar, but do not
know my dot5hosting.com login information. Do I manage the domain
through dot5hosting.com or through opensrs.com?

Otherwise, would it be possible for me to initiate the transfer at
GoDaddy.com and then get a confirmation code from you?
