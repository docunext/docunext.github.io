Is it possible to join SPI? Is it a group, or a corporation? I'm not sure... so I'm emailing someone who I think might know:

<blockquote>

Hi MJ, I've been meaning to apply to become a member of SPI, and when I saw your post today at Planet Debian, I decided to go for it. I went to the website and can't find a "join" link anywhere. Is donating the same as joining? I seem to remember you posting something about how it was only $25 to join. Did I mis-read a post? Thanks for any information you might have.

Oh yeah I also wanted to ask you if you would consider using <a href="http://www.pbooks.org/">PBooks</a> for bookkeeping if I changed the license to GPLv2, Apache, or something else you might recommend.

Thanks again.</blockquote>

Well actually I posted that as a comment on <a href="http://www.news.software.coop/spi-december-2008/415/">MJ's blog</a>.

UPDATE: MJ responded quickly with the right information, so I joined, and my application was approved. Now I'd like to become a contributing member, so I'll have to supply more information. FYI, the link to apply for membership is:

<a href="https://members.spi-inc.org/newnm.php">https://members.spi-inc.org/newnm.php</a>

And its free to join, but donations are always welcome!
