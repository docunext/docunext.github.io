title: OfflineIMAP hook trigger

Wouldn't it be nice if CircleBox could trigger an OfflineIMAP process? To do so, I think some sort of passwordless authentication would be required. Hmmm. I could setup ssh keys without passphrases, and seriously restrict the user's capabilities on the master server.

I've almost figured out how to have Perdition do this upon IMAP login. :-)
