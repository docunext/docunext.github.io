One nice fringe benefit of using <a href="http://www.informedinternet.com/blog/2008/11/fios-disappointment.html">Verizon as an ISP</a> is that it comes with free hosting. Its not the best hosting, but it isn't bad. It comes with 20MB of storage, which is tiny, but for static HTML files, its enough.

So I've decided to use sitecopy and chronicle as a <a href="http://www.established-sites.com/blog/">content management system</a> for the web hosting sites. Its working pretty good!
