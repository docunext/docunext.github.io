I've been using jQuery a lot lately and I'm relly happy with it, and today I found another interesting looking javascript library: <a href="http://js.fleegix.org/">fleegix</a>.

It has a hash tool, which sounds very cool to me, as well as some sort of timezone support. :-)

I found out about it when reviewing Windmill, another web testing toolkit.
