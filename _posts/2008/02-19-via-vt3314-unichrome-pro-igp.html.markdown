I have another VIA mainboard ( <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/EPIA_EN12000EG">EN12000EG</a> ) which I'm trying out various drivers for - the openchrome driver works fine with 3D, which is very nice and seems to work OK with XvWC.

Also, I had a thought about the panel mode with P4M900 and openchrome - maybe if I use the VGA out, it will work better?
