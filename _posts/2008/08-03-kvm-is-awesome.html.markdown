I'm quite pleased with my first foray into KVM. Its a heck of a lot like QEMU, but a lot faster. :-) So far I've installed a Debian and Nexenta system. I'm going to keep using OpenVZ for a lot of tasks, but I'm planning to use KVM for setups which need separate kernels.

I'm also hoping to try out Xen one of these days...
