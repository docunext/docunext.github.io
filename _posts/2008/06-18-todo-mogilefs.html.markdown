title: TODO MogileFS

I'm planning to setup MogileFS one of these days. It appears to be equivalent to the S3 service from Amazon in the way that I would use it. I'd like to store all "big" files in a managed fashion. They are bulky and I think it will be easier to manage them separately. Blobstreaming seems like a good idea, as does S3, but blobstreaming doesn't look quite ready, and S3 costs money. Not a lot, but some. Considering how much I've invested in infrastructure, it doesn't make sense to use S3.
