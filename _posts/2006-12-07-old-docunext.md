The docunext blog has only been going for a couple of weeks now but I'm really into it. Technology, writing, and open source software are some of my favorite things, so its only natural that I would embrace working on it. Furthermore, I am totally impressed with Wordpress, so I'm wondering what I should do with the content from the existing site? Should I just leave it there? Should I convert it to Wordpress? I think that is the best bet. I'll do it one at a time and spread it out. It will take awhile but I think all in all it will be a good move.
