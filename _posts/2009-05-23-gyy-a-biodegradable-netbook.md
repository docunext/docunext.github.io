title: Gyy A Biodegradable Netbook

How's this for a green computer? The Gyy is a low-power machine, made from biodegradable components, that also comes with the option to put solar panels on it.

To me, putting solar panels on such a small device that is probably harder to use in sunlight is a little bit like the solar powered flashlight concept. But, I do appreciate the intent. You could also not use the device while its charging. I just think it would be easier to have a larger solar panel system setup to plug a variety of devices into. That wouldn't work if you were traveling though.
