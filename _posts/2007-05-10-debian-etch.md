      It wasn't luck! :-) Debian Rules! But we still have a lot to figure out: like how to get the mythfrontend working. First thing to do will be to research the tv tuner / video encoder card. I think its a hauppauge mytv or wintv or something like that. Maybe the mythtv wiki has something about it.

We scrapped our attempts at using Knoppmyth to install mythtv because we were experiencing too many problems.  So we instead used debian etch, which worked without any problems luckily.
