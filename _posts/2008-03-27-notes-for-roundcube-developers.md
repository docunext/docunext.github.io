title: Notes for RoundCube Developers

Just my notes:
* Can the roundcube debian package use the tinymce debian package? I removed tiny_mce from circlebox, noted that sending messages doesn't work even when drafting in plain text, so I installed tinymce and symlnked it (/usr/share/tinymce/www/).
* The same would go for the pear packages if they were available as debian packages, but since its fairly trivial, at least with v1 pear package.xml files, to create debian packages from pear packages, should it be done?
