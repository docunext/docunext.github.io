Finally got around to configuring my debian installation kernels! Now using all my cpus and memory. :-)

SMP = multiple processors

Highmem / Bigmem = 900MB+ / 4GB+ / 16GB+?

I have 12GB in one of my machines now. :-)

In case you were wondering "what does smp mean?":

SMP stands for symmetric multi-processors, aka dual or quad processors (or more!). But if you were buying a machine with more than 4 processors, you'd likely know what SMP meant!
