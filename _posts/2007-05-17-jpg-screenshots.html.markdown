This works:

<a href="http://darinmarshall.vox.com/library/post/mac-os-x-screenshot-default-format.html" rel="nofollow">Mac OS X screen shot jpg</a>

<pre>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg</pre>

but I'd also like to change the compression level. How to do that? Doesn't look like its possible...
