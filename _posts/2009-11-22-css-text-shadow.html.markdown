I've added some new CSS to the stylesheet used here at sketch99.com (this is supposed to be a testing ground for new javascript, css, and web development, right?).

It uses the new (at least to me) CSS declaration "text-shadow".

I think it looks nice if its done in a subtle way. What do you think?

Almost forgot the actual CSS:

<pre class="sh_css">
.selector {
    color: #254117;
    text-shadow: rgba(135,145,135,0.65) 2px 2px 3px;
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
}
</pre>
