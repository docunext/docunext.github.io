I'm having a great time with Ruby. I keep blogging about it endlessly. My most recent experience has been with Heroku, and new ruby application hosting platform. The folks behind Heroku have made some decisions I completely agree with, such as using Nginx and Varnish.

I had a little bit of a rough time getting started, but now everything appears to be full on. I started with camping, but now I think I'll switch to a raw rack application, using XSL and XML.
