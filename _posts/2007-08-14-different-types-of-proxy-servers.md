Proxy servers are common to these types of situations:
<ul><li>Caching aggregated content and making it available for faster subsequent access.</li><li>Examining connections and transactions for recording and playback, or routing through a proxy server for testing environments</li></ul>

Squid is a popular choice as a proxy cache server.

Selenium RC and MaxQ are proxy servers for use with testing.
