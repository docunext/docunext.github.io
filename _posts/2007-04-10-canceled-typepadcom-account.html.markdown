Today is the day of cancellations! I just canceled my TypePad.com blogging account. I signed up for the account to learn more about their service so I could help a customer who uses TypePad. I canceled within the 30 day trial period so my account will not be charged.

<blockquote>Thank you for using TypePad. Per your request, your account has been cancelled.</blockquote>
