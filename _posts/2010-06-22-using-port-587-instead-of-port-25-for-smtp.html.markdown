To change the port of your outgoing server, see the bottom screenshot on
this page:

<a href="http://www.docunext.com/outlook-2007-screenshots.html">Outlook 2007 Screenshots</a>

"Outlook Email Options"

You can get there by going to Tools -> Account Settings. Then select
Advanced and then change 25 to 587.

UPDATE: Seems like every ISP (including Verizon FIOS) is now closing port 25!
