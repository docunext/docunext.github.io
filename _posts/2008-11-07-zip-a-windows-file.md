I'm a mac user for the most part, so when I work on a windows machine some tasks that are routine for me vary ever so slightly, and I'm stumped for a moment on how to do them. Today's silly stumper was how to zip a file on my boyfriend's xp machine. It was really easy, but I had to find the right option.<ol>	<li>Right click the file you want to compress</li>	<li>Mouse over to the "Send To" option (it's another drop down menu)</li>	<li>Select the first choice "Compressed (zipped) Folder"</li></ol>

And you're done it's that easy, provided you know where to look. The send to drop down was what confused me. I didn't look there at first because I didn't think it suited the action I was trying to complete. Just goes to show you check every menu if you don't see what you're looking for.
