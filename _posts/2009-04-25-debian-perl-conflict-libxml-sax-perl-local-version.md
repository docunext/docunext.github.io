      I was searching for this too, and it's a well known incompatibility.<br/><br/>This is a problem in the interaction between the CPAN version of XML::SAX and the one Debian packages, or something like that.<br/><br/>When I followed the error's message advice and read /usr/share/doc/libxml-sax-perl/README.Debian.gz (no need to uncompress, just use "less") and used the little Perl script at the end of that to remove XML::SAX (have to "sudo" or it does not do it and does NOT give error, just looks like it was done), things worked fine.

I am running into an error with Perl on Debian, more specifically a conflict with libxml-sax-perl.

<pre class="sh_sh">
Preparing to replace libxml-sax-perl 0.96+dfsg-1 (using libxml-sax-perl_0.96+dfsg-1_all.deb) ...
Unpacking replacement libxml-sax-perl ...

Fatal: cannot call XML::SAX-&gt;save_parsers_debian().
You probably have a locally installed XML::SAX module.

dpkg: error processing libxml-sax-perl (--install): subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1

Errors were encountered while processing: libxml-sax-perl
</pre>

I was able to work around this using:

<pre class="sh_sh">
cd /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/XML/
mkdir dnu
mv SAX* dnu/
apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
</pre>
