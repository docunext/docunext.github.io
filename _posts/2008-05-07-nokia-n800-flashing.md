This will increase the cpu from 330 to 400Mhz!

I was able to run the update today and I'm really glad I did. The entire experience is much, much smoother and slicker. I've got more exploring to do, but wow what a difference. This device keeps getting better and better. If business starts to increase, I'd love to buy one of those Nokia N810's with the slide out keyboard, as that's my main complaint, text entry. </td><td style="padding-left: 10px;"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=inforbanki-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000Y4AH3C&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table>

I have a Nokia 770 I wish would upgrade to the latest version, but alas, it is stuck with the 2006 OS. :-(
