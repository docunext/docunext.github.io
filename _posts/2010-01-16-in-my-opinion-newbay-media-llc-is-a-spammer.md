      I also never provided them my work email address, nor do I give random other companies my work email address; I have a trash-address I use on all but the most trustworthy sites.<br/><br/>I've unsubscribed from newbay media's spam mailings numerous times, which I'm sure just allows them to sell marketing to me for more $$ since they have now confirmed that my address is valid.  Now I just immediately block every domain they send email from.  But of course they change that with every campaign so it has limited effectiveness.<br/><br/>GRRRR ...<br/><br/>If anyone has email addresses for the name list above, please share it so we can let them know how it feels.

      I totally agree.  Their marketing people are ridiculous and clueless on how to purge out their opt-out emails.

NewBay Media LLC is in my opinion a clear and abusive spammer. I believe they obtained my email address from the John Lennon Songwriting Competition, and that is really lame.

Even though I never provided NewBay Media LLC with my email address, I let them know that I did not want to receive emails from them by "managing my subscription" and checking all the boxes that I could to stop them from sending me anything.

Today they sent me another email from Keyboard magazine. I again unsubscribed from their e-preferences, but I doubt its the last I'll hear from them.

Who is NewBay? The website says that this is the management team:

* Steve Palm
* Paul Mastronardi
* Carmel King
* Eric Trabb
* Adam Goldstein
* John Pledger
* Larry Dunn
* Marcia Grand
* Joe Ferrick
* Denise Robbins
* Greg Topf
* Ray Vollmer
* Jack Liedke

Doing a little investigation, it turns out that NewBay is owned by Wicks Group:

* Craig B. Klosk
* Matthew E. Gormly III
* Daniel M. Kortick
* Daniel L. Black
* Jamie M. Weston
* E. Sue Cho
* E.J. Sloboda
* Max von Zuben
* Adam W. Crider
* Thomas P. Kearney III
* Lauren Grzebien
* Kevin F. Brady
* Carter F. Bales
* Edgar R. Berner
