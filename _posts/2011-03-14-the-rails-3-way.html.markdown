My copy of The Rails 3 Way arrived today. I haven't had a chance to dig into it yet, but it looks great - its heavy.

It features forewords by David Heinemeier Hansson and Yehuda Katz, and I noted that the larger sections include:

* ActiveRecord
* Helpers
* ActiveSupport

I'm really looking into reading this tome.

#### Routing

I'm reading the routing section now, and so far its very clear. I'm pleased that routing feels a little bit like Sinatra to me! This is especially nice because the main reason I used Sinatra was because of how simple and light it *was*, and since then its grown a lot more heavy - all the while Rails 3 got a lot more modular.
