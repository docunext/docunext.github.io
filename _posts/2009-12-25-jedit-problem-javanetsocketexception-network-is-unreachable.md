This one had me stumped! Thankfully this [Debian bug report about netbase setting net.ipv6.bindv6only=1 in /etc/sysctl.d/bindv6only.conf](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560044) cleared up the problem for me.

The symptoms included the error:

<pre class="sh_sh">
java.net.socketexception / network is unreachable
</pre>

whenever I tried to refresh the mirror list, update a plugin, or install a plugin. The problem was fixed for me after I ran the command suggested on the Debian bug page:

<pre class="sh_sh">
sudo sed -i 's/net.ipv6.bindv6only\ =\ 1/net.ipv6.bindv6only\ =\ 0/' \
/etc/sysctl.d/bindv6only.conf && sudo invoke-rc.d procps restart
</pre>
