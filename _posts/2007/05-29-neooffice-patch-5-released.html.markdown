I just downloaded the latest patch to NeoOffice, which purportedly includes some performance enhancing upgrades. It seemed to perform fine for me as it was, but I installed it anyway. Maybe I can catch a bug or two. :-)

If you don't know what NeoOffice is, check it out! Its a professional and liberated replacement for Microsoft Office, except much better in my opinion.
