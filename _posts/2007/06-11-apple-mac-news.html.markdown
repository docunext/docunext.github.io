The big conference was today and as usual macrumors.com did a great job covering it. The biggest piece of news in my opinion is that Safari is now available on the PC. That's pretty amazing. I think it will really change the browser landscape for the better. As good as Firefox is, there are many people out there that aren't aware of it, whereas you just can't escape the Apple buzz.

Just noticed this blurb from the macrumors webcast:

 <blockquote>	Head of Apple iPhone software had some trouble typing with the iPhone on-screen keyboard.</blockquote>I will have to see it to believe it: that a software based keyboard will work well. I just can't imagine how it could work.
