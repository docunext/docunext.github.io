I again have to say how much I'm enjoying using Trac - they've built a really nice package for managing software development. I was reading up on the next version, and it appears that they are using a new template engine called genshi, which is supposedly like "kid", which is supposedly like XSLT.

I wonder, why not just use XSLT?
