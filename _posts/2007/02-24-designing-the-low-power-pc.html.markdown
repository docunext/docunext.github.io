 I love to build computers, and I love efficiency. After doing a little surfing on these subjects, I was surprised to find how much power processors consume, compared to say a hard drive.

From what I understand, a drive will consume anywhere from 20-60 watts, while a processor can eat up to 100 watts. Wowzer.

A 3Ware card only consumes about 10 watts, which is awesome.

So a couple of questions I'd like to find answers to: * Do dual-core processors add twice as much "processing power" with a marginal increase in "electrical power" requirements?* How much processing is really required for super fast raid1 and / or raid5?
