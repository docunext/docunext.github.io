We just had a network outage, but thanks to the qualified technicians at Prospeed.net, where we colocate several servers, we were back up and running in about 20 minutes.

Network outages are bound to happen, and that's why I'd like to have a high availability setup at some point. Even if the failover server is not as full power, its better than a complete outage.
