My Macbook gets way too hot! I just tried out two fan controls: "Fan Control"

and "smcFanControl"

and I like smcFanControl better. Simpler and more effective. I think "Fan Control" might be only for Macbook Pros though it does work on regular Macbooks.

You can download it here:

But I also made a backup here:
