      I just started to play around with Trac, and I ran into the exact same problem as you. Installing the libneon26-dev package fixed the problem! Thanks for sharing!

      Glad you got it worked out! I think you'll like Trac a lot - I know I do!

      I had the same problem on Ubuntu, installing libneon26-dev did not work for me. The problem is actually in the clearsilver package which gets confused between python2.4 and python2.5 when both are installed.<br/><br/>The solution which worked for me was:<br/><br/>download package:<br/><br/>python-clearsilver_0.10.4-1ubuntu1_i386.deb<br/><br/>from:<br/><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/i386/python-clearsilver/download" rel="nofollow">http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/i386/python-clearsilver/download</a><br/><br/>install using:<br/><br/>sudo dpkg -i python-clearsilver_0.10.4-1ubuntu1_i386.deb<br/><br/>I hope this solution will help many other desperate souls who are  come across this error after installing Trac on Ubuntu.

Just after I got so excited about Trac I ran into this python error:

<pre>/var/lib/python-support/python2.5/trac/web/clearsilver.py:128:

RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module neo_util:

This Python has API version 1013, module neo_util has version 1012.  import neo_cgi/var/lib/python-support/python2.5/trac/web/clearsilver.py:128:

RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module neo_cs:

I upgraded to libneon26-dev, will that fix it? Odd, I'm still getting the warning, but its working again. Oh well.
