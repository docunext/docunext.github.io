PC Engines is a board designer / manufacturer based in Switzerland. AMD recently stopped manufacturing the chip in their primary product, the WRAP, and PC Engines has selected another AMD chip for a new product: ALIX.

So out goes the WRAP and here comes ALIX, the new lightweight hardware system! I've just emailed PC Engines them with interest in being a beta tester of the ALIX:

<blockquote>I'd be interested in being a beta tester. We do a lot of research on low power embedded devices using open source software, such as astlinux, m0n0wall, and even debian / ubuntu for a wider variety of uses. </blockquote>
