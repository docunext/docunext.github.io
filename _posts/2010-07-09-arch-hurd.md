I just read about Arch Hurd - a "port" of the Arch GNU/Linux distribution to the Hurd platform / kernel.

I'm really pleased to find out about another distribution (in addition to the Debian Hurd team) working on and contributing to development of the Hurd.

**What is the Hurd?**

The Hurd is the micro-kernel from the GNU. Often times, the GNU/Linux operating system is referred to simply as Linux, but Linux is just the kernel. The GNU provides the userland tools that allow users to run and interact with the Linux kernel. The Hurd is still under active development, but it is functional!

I've tried the Debian Hurd QEMU images in the past, but I just found out about a new QEMU image from April 2010, so I've just downloaded it and am planning to try it out.
