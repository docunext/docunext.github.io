<h3>Ruby</h3>Still new to me, Ruby has been around for awhile and its popularity keeps growing. I've noticed a lot more developers using it, and what's really impressed me is the number of very nice applications which are being developed using it:

<ul><li>Redmine</li><li>Radiant</li><li>Puppet
</li><li>Ovirt</li></ul>So I keep wanting to try it out more and more. I've dabbled with some simple systems administration scripts, created a test Ruby on Rails application, and even have tried to create my own Ruby framework (<a href="http://www.neotoyz.com/">NeoToyz</a>) modeled after <a href="http://www.nexista.org/">Nexista</a>. Still, the essence of Ruby evades me. I am persistent though, so it won't evade me forever.

<h3>PHP</h3>PHP was the first scripting language I learned and I still use it all the time. It works great for me, but I feel a need to expand my horizons to other languages. Hopefully I will learn more about programming, data structures, and computer science in general by learning more languages. Nevertheless, I am certain I will continue to use PHP for many years to come.

<h3>Lua</h3>I first learned about Lua from mysql-proxy. I did some more research on it and was impressed with what I found - its a very effificient and small language. Small enough to be embedded into larger applications. I haven't gotten much traction with Lua yet, and after I tackle Ruby some more, I'm going to keep digging into what makes Lua tick.
