I'm not releasing any downloads for version 0.3 as it was such a major shift from 0.2, I'm sure there are residual bugs which need to be squashed.

I'm now pushing forward with 0.4 and there is plenty of instability in the code base, so I'm going to put my effort there. Hopefully things will smooth out and I'll be able to release downloads for 0.4 or 0.5.

Speaking of things to do, PhunkyBB needs to get back on the testing bandwagon!
