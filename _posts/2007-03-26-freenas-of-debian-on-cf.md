Freenas is cool, but for many reasons I'd rather go with debian. Too bad there isn't a debian distribution designed for compact flash installs (low writes, temp logging, readonly mounts, etc).

What  really want:
<h3>A passively cooled, low power, x86 or arm compatible system, with serial IO, keyboad, video, mouse, ethernet, and a slot for memory, all for around $50.</h3>

Is this possible? Should be! Hmmm, just noticed that the <a href="http://mytechdeals.blogspot.com/2007/03/linksys-nslu2-price-drop-at-amazoncom.html">Linksys NSLU2</a> price has been reduced at Amazon.com, its now only $75 and comes with free shipping. Check out the details at <a href="http://mytechdeals.blogspot.com/2007/03/linksys-nslu2-price-drop-at-amazoncom.html">mytechdeals.blogspot.com</a>.

Here's some links I found related to the subject of installing Debian on CF:
