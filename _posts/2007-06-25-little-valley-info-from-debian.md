      Is the onboard NIC supported in Linux and and freebsd?<br/><br/>Can you post a dmesg output from debian?

      Yes it is supported by linux and m0n0wall (which is freebsd). I should have captured a dmesg before I removed debian, but now its running m0n0wall.<br/><br/>Its a broadcom driver, though I couldn't find anything about it.

      No problem - here's an update: it uses the sis0 driver on m0n0wall, which is good!

      An update to my comments about power - it appears that the AC-DC external power converter has a big effect on the power consumption. I'm using a different one now and it's only consuming 23 watts at full power. I'm also using a USB stick instead of compact flash, which could have an effect, though I doubt it.

      I think the p4-clockmod driver only scales the cpu frequency, not the voltage.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>                       "The speedstep-ich or acpi cpufreq modules offer "<br/>                       "voltage scaling in addition of frequency scaling. "<br/>                       "You should use either one instead of p4-clockmod, "<br/>                       "if possible.\n");<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It might help in the reduction of heat however.

      I wonder how does the the picture look on LCD display. Is it sharp ?

      .. and did you try using acpi-cpufreq module instead of p4-clockmod ?

      I can't really say, because I've mainly used it for console output,  meaning that all I see is a command line interface, no graphical user interface. I have no complaints about the console video output.<br/><br/>When it first boots, there is an intel splash screen displaying a fade and a couple of intel logos, that looks good too.<br/><br/>What type of graphics are you referring to mykhal?

      And yes I did try using acpi-cpufreq with no luck. It might be that the board is too new and the acpi-cpufreq driver will support it in the future.

      &gt; What type of graphics are you referring to mykhal?<br/><br/>I am only interested in quality of the integrated video in general - some integrated video cards may have blurry or unstable picture and are not appropriate for using on desktop.

      Gotcha, I've seen that too on an <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/03/22/amcc-3ware-9650se-sata-ii-pci-express-raid-card-review/" rel="nofollow">AOpen machine I built with a 3Ware RAID card, wasn't sure what the issue was but I think it was because the onboard video was analog and was too close to the power supply</a>.<br/><br/>On the Intel D201GLY, I haven't had any such problems at all, the screen is clear for me and not wavy or fuzzy at all.

      What power supply are you using that allows you to get down to 23 watts?<br/>With a run-of-the-mill desktop PSU, mine is using 40 watts.  I'd love to get it down to 23!

      I'm using a DC-DC power supply, the picoPSU. It is very efficient.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.417/.f" rel="nofollow">http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.417/.f</a><br/><br/>You'll need a AC-DC adapter, and I use a molex to 4-pin motherboard cable, but those only cost about a buck or so.

## <strong>Even More Information About the Intel D201gly</strong>

Note: If you are interested in buy a bunch of these, check out the post on my-tech-deals.com for the <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/best-deal-on-the-little-valley.html">best deal on the  Little Valley D201GLY 10-pack</a>.

Now, back to our regular programming of heavy-duty technical information:

Able to use the p4-clockmod cpufreq driver, but it doesn't seem to do much.

When the frequency is at 167Mhz, the bogomips is still 2600. :-|

Seems like no matter what the cpu is set to, it consumes 27 watts of power, and that is with a USB flash drive. Not bad, not great.
