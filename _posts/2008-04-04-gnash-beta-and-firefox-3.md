I still can't get the two to play nicely together, and I'm using Gnash 0.82b and Firefox 3b5. Oh well - I tried out the Gnash version with Firefox 2, and its still pretty buggy on my setup. I can get a few of the flash movies I made here at the Docunext Gallery, but I'm unable to view YouTube, FlowPlayer, or Google Analytics flash movies.

Firefox 3b5 seems nice besides the point.
