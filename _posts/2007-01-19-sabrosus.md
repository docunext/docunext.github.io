I just installed sabrosus, and it works really well. Just as advertised. It's an open-source version of del.icio.us, so you can keep and manipulate your links on your own, without having to depend on another service provider. Now <strong>THAT'S</strong> my type of setup.

What's extra cool - is it also includes an import function to get your links directly from del.icio.us.
