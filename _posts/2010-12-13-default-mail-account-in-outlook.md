title: Default Mail Account in Outlook

I'm doing some research into why one of my clients is unable to change their default mail account in Microsoft Outlook.

So far I've only been able to dig up that it might be an issue caused by "Business Contact Manager" (BCM).

To find a resolution to this issue, I've asked my client to confirm the error message before I continue my digging.
