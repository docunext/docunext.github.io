I've been running on <a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2008/11/12/my-third-verizon-fios-installation-experience/\">Verizon FIOS</a> now for a few months, and I have to say its totally awesome. Problem is, not everyone has it, and still, many of the FIOS packages have slower upload speeds than the download speeds.</p>\n<p>When saving files requires uploading data over a slow network connection, forget about performance. Even at my top FIOS speed - 20mbps - uploads are nothing close to the speed of saving right to the disk.</p>\n<p>For text files its not a big deal, but for pictures, audio, and other rich media, I'll hold off before subscribing. Why aren't we at 100mbps yet?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Problem with Cloud Computing","date":"2009-01-21T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-01-21-the-problem-with-cloud-computing/"}}
