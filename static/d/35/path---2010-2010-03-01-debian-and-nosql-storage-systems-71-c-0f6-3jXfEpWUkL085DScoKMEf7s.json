As such, I installed MemcacheDB and Redis.</p>\n<p>On a demonstration machine, I temporarily added the unstable repository, \"Sid\", as well as the MongoDB repository for the stable Debian distribution, \"Lenny\" (which required I add the official Lenny repository as well). With these extra repositories, I was able to install tokyotyrant and mongodb. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debian and NoSQL Storage Systems","date":"March 1st, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-03-01-debian-and-nosql-storage-systems/"}}
