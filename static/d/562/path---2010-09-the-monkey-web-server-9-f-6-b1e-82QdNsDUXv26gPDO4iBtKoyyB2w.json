{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I tried out the Monkey web server last night to discover if it could easily run the PHP needed for RoundCube.</p>\n<p>Alas, the version of Monkey in Debian is 0.9.x, while PHP support via the <em>Palm</em> plugin / protocol / spawn-fcgi / thingamajig is only available in 0.11.</p>\n<p>What's that you say? Of course I didn't give up! I was trying to find a web server that could easily run PHP. If I have to clone a git repository, disassemble a .deb package or two, <strong>big deal!</strong></p>\n<p>So yes, I did exactly that. I almost got it working, but ran into this error:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nBuilt : Sep 27 2010 20:30:57 (gcc 4.3.5)\nHome  : http://www.monkey-project.com\n(null) => Invalid memory reference\n.\n</pre>\n<p>Doh! I have no clue about that one. Granted, this is a total hackjob! I'll have to spend some more time reviewing debian/rules and should probably build it manually before I continue taking shots in the dark.</p>\n<p>OK, cool! I manually built it and its running fine. Must be something funky with how debian/rules builds it.</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nalbertlash@dev-48-gl:~/src/monkey-project/tmp/monkey-0.11.1$ bin/monkey\nMonkey HTTP Daemon 0.11.1\nBuilt : Sep 28 2010 21:45:48 (gcc 4.3.5)\nHome  : http://www.monkey-project.com\n* Process ID is 25545\n* Server socket listening on Port 2001\n* 5 threads, 101 client connections per thread, total 505\n</pre>\n<p>OK, sweet! I actually got it running after building the debian package, but it will need more work, as I had to manually copy over the conf, and kept on having to remove symlinks that the package was trying to create.
