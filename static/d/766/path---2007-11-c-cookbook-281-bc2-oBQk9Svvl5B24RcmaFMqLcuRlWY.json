I also added the C++ in a Nutshell book as a reference. Its <strong>VERY NEW</strong> stuff to me, but I definitely want to be become more familiar with C and C++ in time.</p>\n<p>I've noticed some terms I am familiar with, but don't really \"own\" the understanding of yet, like mutex, threads, and declarations. Cool, it will be excellent to learn more about these concepts.</p>\n<p>Thankfully there are a bunch of open source C and C++ applications I can delve into, from Apache to tntnet, I should be able to tinker away without too much trouble. In fact, my very first exposure to c++ was the throttle cat code posted to the gentoo forums which could be used for throttling Apache 2 via an external filter. The poster called it \"poor man's throttling\" which in a way it was. There are many ways to throttle bandwidth, and that's probably not the best one.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C Cookbook","date":"November 1st, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/11/c-cookbook/"}}
