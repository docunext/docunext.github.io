{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Q: Max asked a great question: \"Can software break on its own?\"</p>\n<p>A: The simple answer is no, because software can't really do anything on its own. But to extrapolate, can software break without any changes made to the code? Still no, but sort of. For example, if a \"use case\" is introduced to the software that has not yet been tested, the software can break. Very much like the Y2K bug.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Can software break on its own"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-10-26-can-software-break-on-its-own/"}}
