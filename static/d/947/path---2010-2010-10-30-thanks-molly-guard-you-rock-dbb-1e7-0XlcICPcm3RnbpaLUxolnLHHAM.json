Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an IBM 4341 after a programmer's toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you'll see the much less interesting description \"guarded button\".\n</pre></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks: <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/molly-guard.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/molly-guard.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thanks Molly Guard You Rock"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-10-30-thanks-molly-guard-you-rock/"}}
