{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As I recently posted, I'm using O'Reilly's Safari online library service. So far I've really enjoyed the easy access to high quality documentation, and am very impressed with the overall service. I've been slightly disappointed with a few of the books I chose though, for instance:</p>\n<ul><li>Network Troubleshooting Tools - not as advanced as I'd hoped.</li><li>Essential System Administration, 3rd Edition - while a great resource for some, they cover too many operating systems for my purposes. I'll never use Solaris or AIX.</li><li>UNIX Power Tools, 3rd Edition - I had higher expectations for this one, and am still holding out hope that I'll be able to garner some nuggets of wisdom from it.</li></ul>\n<p>The problem with the latter two items is that they take up two slots each! Ouch.</p>\n<p>The ones I've really liked are:</p>\n<ul><li>Designing Large-Scale LANs</li><li>DNS and BIND, 5th Edition</li><li>Linux Server Hacks Volumes 1 and 2</li><li>Understanding Linux Network Internals (I own a hardcopy too)</li></ul>\n<p>Safari is not only a great reference tool, its also a really good \"preview\" tool to check out potential books to buy. I've made the mistake of buying a book thinking it is one thing when it is really about another, or that it is too advanced or basic for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"O Reilly Book Reviews","date":"February 27th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/02/oreilly-book-reviews/"}}
