Please advise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Albert</li>\n</ul>\n<p>091024-000242</p>\n<p>UPDATE: APCC did respond back with some suggestions (letting the unit cool down, flip it upside down), but I'd already tried everything. I wrote them back:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Hi, I got your responses but I had already tried everything. The device has been unplugged for several weeks and the batteries aren't getting any cooler. They are just so warped their middle section is rounder bigger than the rectangle slot they are meant to slide out of. The only way I could imaging that they could come out is if the entire unit is disassembled. Please tell me how I can exchange this one.\"<blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"APCC Smart UPS 1000VA","date":"October 23rd, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-10-23-apcc-smart-ups-1000va/"}}
