{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I thought this fix suggesting the problem was caused by a <a href=\"http://www.splatdot.com/2009/05/ubuntu-9-04-jaunty-jackalope-problems-fixed/\">missing symlink in /etc/rcS.d</a> but unfortunately that didn't fix the problem.</p>\n<p>I have this in my /etc/fstab, but for whatever reason that still isn't working right. I'll have to keep logging in like this:</p>\n<pre>ssh mymachine \"bash -e\"</pre>\n<p>and then mounting /dev/pts manually. Strange, but true. FYI, this is on debian machine.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I scanned /var/log/syslog for udev errors and found this:</p>\n<pre>\nkernel: udev: missing sysfs features; please update the kernel or disable the kernel's CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED option; udev may fail to work correctly\n</pre>\n<p>I updated to 2-6-30 and was able to login without any issues. I still have devpts in my fstab, so I guess I should remove it and test it again. I'll do it next week. :-)</p>\n<p>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2009/06/ssh-error-pty-allocation-request-failed-on-channel-0.html\">Ssh Error: PTY allocation request failed on channel 0</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Another PTY allocation request failed on channel 0","date":"November 3rd, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-11-03-another-pty-allocation-request-failed-on-channel-0/"}}
