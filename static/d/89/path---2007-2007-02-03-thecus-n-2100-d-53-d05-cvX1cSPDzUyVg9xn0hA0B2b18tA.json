{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Thecus n2100 is a pretty sweet machine. I'm pleased with it already. It can really run debian! I also have an NSLU2 which I've installed Debian on as well.</p>\n<p>The Thecus I have came with a 9-pin console port which I was able to connect to (thank goodness!), and then I was able to see what I did wrong when following the install instructions. This was actually a really amazing process for me - I've connected to a Cisco switch via minicom, but never another linux machine. I'm sure this will come in handy again soon.</p>\n<p>Here's the links I collected in researching the n2100:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=openbsd-arm&a=2006-12&t=2679840\">Shows startup over serial</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/n2100/install.html\">Debian Install on n2100</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://gnumonks.org/~laforge/weblog/2006/02/24/#20060224-thecus\">GPL Violations by thecus</a>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.debonaras.org/wiki/Info/ThecusN2100\">Debonaras Thecus 2100 page</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2006/10/msg00024.html\">Mailing list archive</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://david.thg.se/n2100/\">Outdated install debian on thecus 2100</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://onbeat.dk/thecus/index.php/N2100_Recovering_from_a_bad_config_change\">http://onbeat.dk/thecus/index.php/N2100<em>Recovering</em>from<em>a</em>bad<em>config</em>change</a></p>\n<p>My mistake: not changing the hostname on the thecus before installing the installer!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alcopop.org/log/debian/\">http://alcopop.org/log/debian/</a> - this page mentions the process for using a raid on the thecus with debian, you need the kernel modules.
