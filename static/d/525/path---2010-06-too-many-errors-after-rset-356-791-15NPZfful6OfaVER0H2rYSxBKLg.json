I tried to figure out what was going on, but in the end had to switch to port 587.</p>\n<h4><strong>New Report</strong></h4>\n<p>The latest report was also able to be fixed by switching to port 587, but the client didn't inform me that Norton was issuing warnings at first. I did some digging and finally found the \"<strong>too many errors after RSET</strong>\" error (from Postfix), but was unable to diagnose it until he mentioned Norton.</p>\n<p>While I was at it, I raised the error limit which causes a disconnect when the client sends too many junk commands:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nsmtpd_junk_command_limit = 1000\n</pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"too many errors after RSET","date":"June 14th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/06/too-many-errors-after-rset/"}}
