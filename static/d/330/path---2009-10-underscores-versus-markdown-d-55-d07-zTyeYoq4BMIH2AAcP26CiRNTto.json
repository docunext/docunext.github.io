{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">markdown</a> syntax. I'm using it right now as I write this post via Movable Type Open Source, I use it with <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Ikiwiki\">ikiwiki</a>, and believe it or not, I also use it when writing letters and business documents. <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Pandoc\">Markdown2pdf</a> makes it even better.</p>\n<p>However I do have one problem. There is a clash between the file naming convention I'm used to and the way italics is activated within Markdown.</p>\n<div>I really wish that the author had chosen something like the tilda (~) instead of the underscore (_)!</div>\n<p>I've written before about <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2009/07/trends-in-technical-syntax-hyphens-and-underscores/\">the importance of hyphens and underscores to programmers</a>. In an obscure way, this is similar to the situation with ampersands (&#x26;) and XML.</p>\n<p>I never understood why the ampersand was chosen as an entity token. Perhaps the writers of the specification didn't know how incredibly common a punctuation mark it is.</p>\n<p>Like the ampersand in XML, I'm under the impression that its not a trivial task to globally alter the syntax parser of Markdown. Maybe its time to consider an alternative?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Underscores versus Markdown","date":"October 31st, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/10/underscores-versus-markdown/"}}
