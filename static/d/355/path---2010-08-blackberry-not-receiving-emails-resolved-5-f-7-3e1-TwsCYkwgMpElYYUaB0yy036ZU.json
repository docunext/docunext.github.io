So what to do when your Blackberry isn't receiving emails? I did some internet spelunking and found some advice: fully reboot your phone!</p>\n<p>So I advised my client - if you want to get your Blackberry to start receiving email once again, try fully rebooting it, and by fully rebooting it, I mean:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turn off the Blackberry</li>\n<li>Remove the battery from the Blackberry</li>\n<li>Leave the battery out for at least thirty seconds</li>\n<li>Put the battery back in the Blackberry and turn it on</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While mileage may vary, this solution restored the email service to my client's Blackberry. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blackberry Not Receiving Emails RESOLVED","date":"August 16th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/08/blackberry-not-receiving-emails-resolved/"}}
