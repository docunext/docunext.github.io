{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have both a Gmail hosted account and a regular Gmail account. Problem is that since they both use the domain name www.gmail.com, my browser's save password function sees them as the same function. I wish they would handle this the same way their analytics service (which is awesome) handles multiple accounts - you can share access between different logins, and easily switch between the various accounts. Actually its one of the best account management solutions I've seen, even beating out online banking systems.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gmail and Gmail hosted","date":"2006-12-09T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/2006-12-09-gmail-and-gmail-hosted/"}}
