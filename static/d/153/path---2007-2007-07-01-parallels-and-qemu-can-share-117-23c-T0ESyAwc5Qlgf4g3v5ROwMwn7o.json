This is like taking a hard drive out of one machine and plugging it into a different one, and expecting everything to work. It usually doesn't, but it seems like the QEMU and Parallels machines are similar enought to not cause a catastrophe. This is really awesome for me because I'll be able to use the same image on my Macbook as well as my linux workstations and servers.</p>\n<p>Parallels:</p>\n<p>QEMU:</p>\n<p>Now to figure out how to setup vde...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Parallels and QEMU can SHARE","date":"July 1st, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-01-parallels-and-qemu-can-share/"}}
