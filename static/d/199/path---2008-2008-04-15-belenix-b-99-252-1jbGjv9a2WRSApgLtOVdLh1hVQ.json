{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I tried using the <a href=\"http://www.genunix.org/distributions/belenix_site/?q=home\">BeleniX</a> liveCD today and I was actually pretty impressed. One question though: when it starts up, there is text that says copyright Sun Microsystems, usage subject to license terms. It doesn't say what those terms are, though. GPL v2, I presume?</p>\n<p>I liked that the liveCD gives you the choice of using XFCE, KDE, or Compiz - surprising. Totally cool.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"BeleniX","date":"2008-04-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-04-15-belenix/"}}
