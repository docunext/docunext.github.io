{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ikiwiki blogs / wikis support OpenID identity logins out-of-the-box, so I've decided to sign up for one. I had previously setup an OpenID server, but since I don't want to bother with that again right now, I just signed up with Verisign.</p>\n<p>It was fast and easy, and I've already used it to login to one blog to make a comment. MovableType uses it too, so I'm looking forward to using it for that as well.</p>\n<p>I'll probably setup an OpenID server again at some point in the future when I have a few more minutes to spare.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I'm still using Verisign, but I've changed my OpenID to use a domain I own, and then I delegate authentication to them. Its much better that way, because if Verisign stops offering the service, or I decide to use a different one, I won't have to update all the previous references to my identity. Hooray for delegation!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I ve Signed Up for OpenID"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-06-04-ive-signed-up-for-openid/"}}
