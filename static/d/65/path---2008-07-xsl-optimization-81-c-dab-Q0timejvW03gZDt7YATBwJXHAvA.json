{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've been benchmarking XSL-powered applications quite a bit lately, and I've come up with a few tips which have helped improve the performance of my apps:</p>\n<ul><li>Avoid \"//\" - it requires scanning the entire tree\n</li><li>Cache the parsed style sheet, if possible\n</li><li>Reduce the size of the XML document\n</li><li>Use keys, parameters, and variables as necessary to avoid repeating the same lookups</li></ul>\nI've heard people say that including / importing stylesheets can have an adverse affect on performance, but I haven't noticed. It may cause a performance impact if the style sheets are not cached, but I'm caching mine and it doesn't make a difference.\n<p>It goes without saying that any dynamically generated content can be optimized through caching, and XSL is no exception.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"XSL Optimization","date":"July 5th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/07/xsl-optimization/"}}
