{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h4>First Attempt to Install Shapado</h4>\n<p>I'm trying to install <strong>shapado</strong>, a stackoverflow clone running on top of Ruby on Rails. It looks like a very solid piece of software. The shapado installation instructions are clear, but I've hit this snag:</p>\n<pre class=\"terminal\">\nFailed to connect to a master node at localhost:27017\n</pre>\n<p>Ah! Its because I don't have mongodb running locally.</p>\n<p>UPDATE on my efforts to (and failure to) install shapado:</p>\n<p>I have given up on installing shapado, only because the version that uses Rails 3 requires a version on the mongo driver that as of yesterday was only available for Jruby, and as of today has been yanked from Rubygems. Hopefully they'll bring a fresh version of the mongo driver back and it will be compatible with Ruby 1.9.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Shapado Failed to connect to a master node at localhost 27017","date":"October 28th, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2011/10/failed-to-connect-to-a-master-node-at-localhost27017/"}}
