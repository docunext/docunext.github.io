{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My recent post about <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2010/10/just-say-no-to-scaffolding.html\">whether or not to use scaffolding</a> has come home to roost!</p>\n<p><em>This only has to do with generating a controller, but it embodies some of my opinions of automatically generating code.</em></p>\n<p>Well, <em>sort of</em>. The subject of this post: <strong>No route matches {:action=>\"destroy\"</strong> refers to a rails 3 error that apparently involves the treatment of singular and plural references. I've come across the treatment of singular and plural nomenclature via DataMapper, but it was simpler to comprehend because I was actively modeling my data structures.</p>\n<p>By generating a controller and views with rails 3, the objects felt more distant, and I don't like that. To me it seems like remote control sculpture! I like to <strong>feel</strong> what I'm working on. Know what I mean?</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I don't like to automatically generate code, but I'm warming up to the idea. I'm a huge fan of task automation, which is how I learned to stop worrying and love the command line.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No route matches action destroy","date":"2010-10-31T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-10-31-no-route-matches-actiondestroy/"}}
