{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As a follow-up to my post about the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/10/nyt-xslcache.html\">New York Times XSLT cache package</a>, I emailed the debian mentors list asking for some help in packaging it correctly.</p>\n<p>Felipe Augusto van de Wiel was kind enough to write back to me with a few tips. Here's a new control file:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nPackage: php5-xsltcache\nVersion: 5.2.3\nSection: web\nPriority: optional\nArchitecture: i386\nDepends: php5-common (>=5.2), php5-xsl\nMaintainer: Albert Lash\nHomepage: http://code.nytimes.com/projects/xslcache\nDescription: PHP 5 XSLTCache Similar to php5-xslt, php5-xsltcache caches xsl documents in permanent memory, but keeps an eye on modification time of referenced file.\n</pre>\n<p>Not too different, but I did added the Hompage field. I'm also going to create a php5-xsltcache.dsc (debian source package) and a pointer to the original archive, per Felipe's suggestions. One step at a time!</p>\n<p>Oh yes, I also learned that there is a package status called \"lintian clean\", which I believe to mean that the package conforms to debian standards. I've decided to take myself off the mentors list until I have a little more time to dedicate to this.</p>\n<p>For reference:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html\">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating Debian Packages Part II","date":"November 11th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-11-11-creating-debian-packages-part-ii/"}}
