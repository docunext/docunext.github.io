Ouch!</p>\n<p>Usually my energy bills are around $100 or less, and this one was much higher because I've had more computers on 24/7. I've been doing a lot of migrating of things around, and since one of my networks is pretty slow, its been taking a long time. Thankfully the new network will be much faster, and it has computers that are more energy efficient on it.</p>\n<p>I'm aiming to keep the electricity bills under $100 if possible.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Saving Energy Pays"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-01-21-saving-energy-pays/"}}
