Furthermore, dd and an extended partition table don't seem to get along, so I've been instead using this process to ghost and duplicate disk drives with my correct settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>backup mbr</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>backup first and only partition from the drive, to keep it manageable, I limit the install size to 2gb. I can always shuffle around some stuff later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>plug in a new drive</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>restore the mbr - the kernel should then re-read the new partition table</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>restore the first and only partition</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully that works!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Rather than mucking around with the mbr and partition table, I'm just dd'ing the disk device from the beginning to a little past the end of the size of my data. If I have three partitions that take up 6GB, I'll dd from 0 to 7GB. So far its worked OK.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ghosting Notes backup dd","date":"2006-08-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/2006-08-15-ghosting-notes/"}}
