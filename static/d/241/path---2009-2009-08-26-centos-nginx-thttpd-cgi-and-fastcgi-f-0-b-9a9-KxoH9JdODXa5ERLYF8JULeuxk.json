{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm trying out CentOS and so far I'm finding it quite nice and simple. It has many fewer packages than Debian, but in some ways that's a good thing.</p>\n<p>Yum is very fast, and a minimal installation of centos has a very light footprint on memory and storage.</p>\n<p>To keep along those lines, I'm working with NGINX and FastCGI. Since NGINX does not spawn FastCGI processes, I'm using thttpd and its CGI capabilities to do that job for it.</p>\n<p>So far so good:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">[root@vpn-stars cgi-bin]# pstree\ninit-+-blah.fcgi\n     |-hellua.fcgi\n     |-klogd\n     |-master-+-pickup\n     |        `-qmgr\n     |-nginx---nginx\n     |-sshd---sshd---bash---pstree\n     |-syslogd\n     `-thttpd\n[root@vpn-stars cgi-bin]# free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:            64         22         41          0          0          0\n-/+ buffers/cache:         22         41\nSwap:            0          0          0\n</pre>\n<p>With FastCGI and CGI, the idea is that the FastCGI processes can be shutdown if they aren't being used for awhile, and then NGINX can re-route requests to a thttpd cgi-bin binary which can then make a system call to spawn-fcgi.
