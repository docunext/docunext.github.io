{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Awhile back, I wrote about wanting a <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/02/wishlist-network-based-configuration.html\">method to use LDAP to store configuration files</a>, so I was really pleased when I read that there is an experimental backend for debconf which uses LDAP.</p>\n<p>I <em>have</em> to try this out!</p>\n<p>While I was reading up on debconf, I also noticed that there is a web interface frontend for it. And since its easy to try out, I did. I reconfigured proftpd as I knew it had an easy configuration process (one question whether to use inetd or run standalone). As explained in the debconf docs, the shell provides a url, which I loaded in elinks and was able to reconfigure proftpd.</p>\n<p>Debconf is a sweet program, I can tell already. I fear it uses a lot of bash to do its thing though - maybe xsl can fit in there somehow.</p>\n<h4>Other LDAP Stuff</h4>\n<p><strong>libapache2-mod-vhost-ldap</strong> looks great - it can be used with the threaded, worker apache2 mpm. I am currently using mod_rewrite to power virtual hosts, but something like ldap might be a better choice for easier and faster management.</p>\n<p>And that's not all - most of my othe favorite packages have ldap interfaces.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debconf LDAP Backend","date":"2008-04-26T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-04-26-debconf-ldap-backend/"}}
