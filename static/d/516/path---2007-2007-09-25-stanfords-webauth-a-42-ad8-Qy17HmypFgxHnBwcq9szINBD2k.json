{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Last nice I came across Stanford's WebAuth site again, and this time took a second look at it. Couple of things I noticed:</p>\n<ul><li>Interfaces with Kerberos or Shibboleth (actually I think Kerberos might be needed on both)</li><li>Reminds me somewhat of OpenID - one \"server\" required, many \"clients\"</li><li>Uses cookies for \"single sign-on\" capabilities</li><li>Hooks / modules exist for Apache, LDAP, Cyrus SASL, and CURL</li></ul>\n<p>Questions to answer:</p>\n<ul><li>Do the \"client sites\" that hook back into the WebKDC need to networked to each other?</li><li>What does KDC stand for?</li></ul>\n<p>I use Cyrus SASL in my mail servers, and CURL in some of my PHP implementations, and I defintely use Apache all the time in many instances. I've experimented with LDAP and would love to get it more integrated with our operations, but I just haven't gotten a firm enough grasp of it. And from the community side, it seems to have solid but slightly waning support as a protocol - its respected but not widely popular. Why is that I wonder? Am I missing something?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/services/webauth/\">stanford.edu/services/webauth/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Stanford s WebAuth","date":"September 25th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-09-25-stanfords-webauth/"}}
