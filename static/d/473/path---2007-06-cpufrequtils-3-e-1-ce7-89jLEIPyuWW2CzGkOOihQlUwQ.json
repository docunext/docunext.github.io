{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After manually wrestling with cpufreq kernel modules for the longest time, I finally found cpufrequtils. It works great, allowing me to manually set governors and frequencies much easier than the long-handed method.  If you ever work with CPU power saving technologies, I highly suggest you check it out. With the apt-get package manager and an appropriate source, its as easy as:</p>\n<pre>apt-get install cpufrequtils</pre>\n<p>This will install cpufreq-info and cpufreq-set. That should be enough to get you started, good luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"cpufrequtils","date":"June 7th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/06/cpufrequtils/"}}
