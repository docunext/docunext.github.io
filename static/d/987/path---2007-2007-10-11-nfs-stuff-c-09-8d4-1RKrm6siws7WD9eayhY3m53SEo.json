{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm liking NFS more and more. My notes for today:</p>\n<h4>NFS Server</h4>\n<p>Easy to setup on debian, apt-get install nfs-kernel-server. It will include the required dependencies. Edit /etc/exports.</p>\n<h4>NFS Client</h4>\n<p>I was setting up NFS on a minimal linux server, so in my kernel I added support for NFS client. Then when I tried to mount, I received these errors:</p>\n<pre>rpcbind: server localhost not responding, timed out\nRPC: failed to contact local rpcbind server (errno 5).</pre>\n<p>That is because I wasn't running a local portmapper service. To avoid having to do so, I used these options:</p>\n<pre>mount -t nfs -o nolock example.com:/export /import</pre>\n<p>That worked for me. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NFS Stuff","date":"2007-10-11T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-10-11-nfs-stuff/"}}
