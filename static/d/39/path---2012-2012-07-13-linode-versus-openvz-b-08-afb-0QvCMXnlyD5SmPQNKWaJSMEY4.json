The\nother rebooted fine (yes I'm that type of guy) the first time, but not the\nsecond. A couple hours later, both booted fine again. I still value linode\n(because they rock), but I think due to debian's dropping of OpenVZ support I'll\nswitch to LXC.</p>\n<p>The problem with LXC is that it doesn't support resource constraints, so\npresumably one container could starve out another, but it is planned. And in the\ncase of LXC, planned is OK, as in the short time I've been using it (about\na year) its support in Debian / Ubuntu / Mint has drastically improved.</p>\n<p>The other feature I'll miss from OpenVZ is vzdump's support of lvm snapshots.\nI'll be able to do pretty much the same thing with lxc, but I'll have to do it\nmanually with lvm and tar. Not a big deal.</p>\n<h3>A Real Fix:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?p=46969&#x26;sid=6873e12cb6c1ef65e3ca1917bb34531f\">http://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?p=46969&#x26;sid=6873e12cb6c1ef65e3ca1917bb34531f</a></p>\n<p>Reducing the amount of RAM that is available to the host machine via the linode\npanel.</p>\n<h3>Syslog-ng in OpenVZ</h3>\n<p>No caps!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pyro.eu.org/how-to/micro/syslog-ng-error-setting-capabilities-openvz.txt\">http://pyro.eu.org/how-to/micro/syslog-ng-error-setting-capabilities-openvz.txt</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Linode versus OpenVZ"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012/2012-07-13-linode-versus-openvz/"}}
