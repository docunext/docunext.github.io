{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>One of my clients recently requested a bulk mailing to their opted-in fan email list.</p>\n<p>I timed one of the mailings, and it came to almost thirty two hours to send approximately fifty thousand emails.</p>\n<p>It could have been done <em>much</em> faster, but I preferred sending it that way. Its much easier to manage and monitor. To accomplish this, I used PHP / PEAR's Mail class, and issued a sleep command of two seconds between each single email getting sent out.</p>\n<p>I'm quite pleased to learn that PHP can run for thirty two hours and exit successfully. Cool!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bulk Email Timing","date":"August 2nd, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-08-02-bulk-email-timing/"}}
