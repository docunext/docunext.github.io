{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Now that I've actually used both Redis and MongoDB a little, I have to say I really like them both a lot. In tandem with using these two, I also worked with MemcacheDB and Tokyo Tyrant. I like those too, but I want to write about Redis and MongoDB because they have substantially different features than what I've been familiar with in the past.</p>\n<h4>Redis</h4>\n<p>For me, the absolute most awesome feature about Redis is the native list data type. I'm already thinking about all the lists I'm going to create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server logs</li>\n<li>Software packages</li>\n<li>States</li>\n<li>Colors</li>\n<li>Hardware manufacturers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, I'm really looking forward to having that information readily available!</p>\n<p>The fact that lists can be truncated makes circular logging super easy too!</p>\n<h4>MongoDB</h4>\n<p>Oooh... I'm not sure where to start on this. I've setup <a href=\"http://www.labs.docunext.com/demo/doculabsappone/news/\">a little blog engine on Docunext Labs</a> using MongoDB and I'm impressed! MongoDB is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fast</li>\n<li>Flexible</li>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It has a nice \"vibe\" to it. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reviews of Redis and MongoDB","date":"March 2nd, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/03/reviews-of-redis-and-mongodb/"}}
