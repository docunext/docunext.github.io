{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>RoundCube is a webmail client (IMAP) written in PHP.

While I'd dabbled with RoundCube here and there in the past, I'm now using it regularly and so I can easily say:</p>\n<h4>\"RoundCube Rocks!\"</h4>\n<p>Like most IMAP email clients, it can manage folders with ease. However, unlike some webmail clients, it has the ability to connect with a relational database (SQLite, MySQL, etc) to store contacts and signature information. It can also connect with LDAP servers for this!!</p>\n<p>I'm eager to try out RoundCube plugins, particularly the managesieve plugins so that I can automatically organize my emails.</p>\n<p>Have you tried RoundCube?
