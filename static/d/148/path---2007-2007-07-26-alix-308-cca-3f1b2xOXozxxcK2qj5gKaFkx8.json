{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My new PC Engines ALIX motherboard / computer arrived from Switzerland yesterday, here are some pictures:</p>\n<p>This thing is awesome. It is my new \"favorite\"! Comes with 256MB of RAM, an on-board graphics card, 44-pin storage headers, compact flash slot, 10/100 ethernet, serial port, mini-pci port, full size pci slot, and on-board power supply (meaning you don't need a separate power supply like the PicoPSU, you can just plug in a 12V power supply. Receptacle is 2.5mm id and 5.5 od - I think!).</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, only uses 4-6 watts of power under normal use, and makes no noise as it doesn't have a fan. It doesn't even need a heatsink!</p>\n<p>UPDATE August 16th, 2007: The plug receptacle is indeed 2.5mm id and 5.5mm od, at least that's the size on my ALIX board. Check with PC Engines for exact measurements.</p>\n<p>UPDATE November 11, 2007: More pictures of the ALIX-series boards:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/09/pc-engines-alix-with-the-amd-geode-lx800.html\">ALIX 2B3 @ My-Tech-Deals.com</a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ALIX","date":"July 26th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-26-alix/"}}
