Then that same week another user's Outlook stopped displaying new mail. For no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>The first issue was fixed by reverting the Outlook update, and the second was fixed by recreating the user's Outlook account.</p>\n<p>Thankfully another user who was experiencing similar difficulty with Outlook and IMAP was willing to try Thunderbird. So far, so good. I'm confident he will be glad he switched.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Outlook 0x800CCC17 Unable to Download Folder","date":"May 6th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-05-06-outlook-0x800ccc17-unable-to-download-folder/"}}
