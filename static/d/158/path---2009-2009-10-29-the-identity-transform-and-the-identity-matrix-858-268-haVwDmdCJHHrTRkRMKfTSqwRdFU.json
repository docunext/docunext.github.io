{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have recently experienced a renewed interest in mathematics. I loved it as a young child and throughout the start of high school, but lost interest as my focus shifted to cars, girls, and college parties.</p>\n<p>After perusing some pages on Mathworld at the Wolfram Research website and feeling quite bewildered, I felt so relieved when I came upon the page for the identity matrix.</p>\n<p>I have long since remembered matrices and how they are built, but my recent and relatively often use of identity transforms in XSLT which made the identity matrix so familiar.</p>\n<p>In my understanding, identity transforms can perform a transformation on an input XML document and produce the output XML which is the same as the input XML.</p>\n<p>The concept is similar with the identity matrix. A matrix which is multiplied by an identity matrix produces an outcome identical to the original, non-identity matrix.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I am dull, but I think this is cool stuff.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Identity Transform and The Identity Matrix"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-10-29-the-identity-transform-and-the-identity-matrix/"}}
