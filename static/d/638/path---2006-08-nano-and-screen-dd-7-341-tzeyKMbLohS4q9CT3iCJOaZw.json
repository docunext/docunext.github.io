{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>On a few distributions (not to name names, but RedHat and Debian), nano comes with an annoying configuration, where backspace is a forward delete.</p>\n<p>To fix this, uncomment the following line in /etc/nanorc:\n<pre>#set rebinddelete</pre></p>\n<p>The GNU screen software has a similar issue. When I hit &quot;delete&quot; it barks &quot;Wuff! Wuff!&quot;. You can make your screen delete work again by calling TERM=screen screen. Add alias screen='TERM=screen screen' to your bash profile to simplify your life.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=90910\">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=90910</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nano and Screen","date":"August 14th, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/08/nano-and-screen/"}}
