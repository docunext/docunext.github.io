{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Its nice when stuff works well, don't you think? That's why I have to give props to CISCO. I recently was able to setup a VLAN on a 2960 switch using an instructional guide available at their website, fully readable by elinks.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? On my servers, I don't install a graphical user interface, and if I want to use the web, I can surf using a text-only browser. It works great on well-structured web pages, which CISCO has. I'm not sure if they did that on purpose, of if it was just a coincidence, but either way I was VERY glad it worked. :-)</p>\n<p>On top of that, everything in the guide worked perfectly, we well written, and easy to follow, even on a text browser.</p>\n<p>FYI - I have no relationship with CISCO, other than being a customer. I own one CISCO switch, a 2960, and it was a big purchase for my company. For the most part, we can't afford CISCO equipment, but as we grow, I hope that the high purchase price will result in cost savings down the road due to increased operations and reduced labor expenses.</p>\n<p>For their part, CISCO (as far as I know) has been a decent corporate citizen, not bullying their competitors out of business, or using fear, uncertainty, and doubt as a marketing tool. They do manage their intellectual property well and will sue when they are able to (they had a scuffle with the IETF and OpenBSD developers over their patent for hot router transfer protocol, which resulted in a new protocol called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Address_Redundancy_Protocol\" rel=\"nofollow\">CARP</a>, and I hope they had good reason to do so.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, good work CISCO! If you know anything about CISCO misbehaving or generally being a corporate miscreant, I'd like to hear about it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kudos to CISCO","date":"2007-09-02T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-09-02-kudos-to-cisco/"}}
