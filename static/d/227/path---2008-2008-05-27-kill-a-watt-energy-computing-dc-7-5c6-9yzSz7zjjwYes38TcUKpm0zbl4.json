{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We've been building various computers with different components and operating systems.  After that we've been taking power measurements with a little device called a Kill-A-Watt, this basically gives you the wattage output of the machine you plug it into.  It's interesting to see how the power usage levels vary from machine to machine.  One PC used around 80 watts, while another was over 100.  I'm not sure exactly what parts of a machine effect the overall power amount the most, or if the particular OS has anything to do with it.  These are the computers we have logged thus far.  We will be adding more as we build them.<strong>Computer 1</strong>80GB SATA</p>\n<p>Austin Power Supply</p>\n<p>DR-B300ATX</p>\n<p>AMD====> No CPU Frequency</p>\n<p>K9VGM-V MS1 MS-7253-Ver 1.1</p>\n<p>IDE CDROM</p>\n<p>Nexenta 6<strong>Computer 2</strong></p>\n<p>Athlon 3400</p>\n<p>M861G V16a</p>\n<p>SATA 80GB</p>\n<p>ATX 480W Generic PS82 Watts<strong>Computer 3</strong></p>\n<p>Allied Power Supply</p>\n<p>Model AL - A250ATX</p>\n<p>Max 250W</p>\n<p>Debian OS100+ Watts</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kill A Watt Energy Computing"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-05-27-kill-a-watt-energy-computing/"}}
