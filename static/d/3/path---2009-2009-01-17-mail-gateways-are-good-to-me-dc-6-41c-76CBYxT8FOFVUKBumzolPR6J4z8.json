{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sing along... mail gateways have been good to me so far...</p>\n<p>Seriously though - I'm really liking email gateways. Just a postfix setup to relay (aka route) mail to different servers. Its kind of like an email firewall in a way. I am keeping some things in mind when configuring mine:* Need to keep an updated list of all recipients behind the gateway to prevent backscatter mail* Perdition!* Need to have a failover</p>\n<p>What are the benefits? Easier administration, especially when it comes to defending against spam: greylisting, spamassassin, and dnsrbls are all consolidated, also making for a more efficient operation. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mail Gateways Are Good To Me","date":"January 17th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-01-17-mail-gateways-are-good-to-me/"}}
