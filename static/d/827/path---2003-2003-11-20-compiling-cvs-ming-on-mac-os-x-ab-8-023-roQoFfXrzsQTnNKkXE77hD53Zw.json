{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>New effort:</p>\n<p>Used plumber fixes from the Ming wiki. Copied the libming.a that I created manually to the build/ming-build/ directory, then copied several files from the ming/php_ext/ directory to the php-5.0.3/ext/ming/ directory. Really not sure if that will work, but work a try. Had created a backup copy of the php-503/ext/ming/ dir but had to remove it.</p>\n<p>The problem here is not compiling Ming, that compiles OK, can't get it to work with PHP 5, it seems like there is some dependency in the PHP code /ext/ming/ that is preventing it from working OK.</p>\n<p>Finally got it to work. First it was the libxml2 that needed to be updated, then once that was updated, libxslt compiled OK. For Ming, I had to edit the php-5.0.4/ext/ming/ming.c and php_ming.h files. (While I was at it, I ended u pgrabbing the latest version of PHP from the snapshot page). I commented out a bunch of lines that were causing errors and it compiled OK, then I added the required code for PrebuiltClip, which is an absolute necessity for me. Finally, it compiled OK and installed OK and works!</p>\n<p>I've saved the dmg as a backup, but should probably save the entire setup for future usage.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Compiling CVS ming on Mac OS X"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2003/2003-11-20-compiling-cvs-ming-on-mac-os-x/"}}
