{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is a blog post about an error I found in my /var/log/mail.log file reported by postfix: \"<strong>SASL authentication failure: cannot connect to saslauthd server: No such file or directory</strong>\", and the solution I used to resolve it.</p>\n<p>First off, this turned out to be a very interesting error! As I explained on the Docunext Wiki Postfix page in the section about using <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Postfix#Postfix_and_SASL\">Postfix and Saslauthd on Debian</a>, Postfix processes must run under a chroot.</p>\n<p>While the submission service (port 587) in /etc/postfix/master.cf usual runs under a chroot, I had added a new submission directive to relay outgoing messages through dkimproxy:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nsubmission  inet  n     -       n       -       -       smtpd\n    -o smtpd_etrn_restrictions=reject\n    -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes\n    -o content_filter=dksign:[127.0.0.1]:10028\n    -o receive_override_options=no_address_mappings\n    -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject\n</pre>\n<p>For some reason, I had set chroot to \"n\", and so it was unable to connect to the saslauthd socket!</p>\n<p>The resolution for me was to simply change the second \"n\" to \"-\", like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nsubmission  inet  n     -       -       -       -       smtpd\n</pre>\n<p>Voila!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SASL authentication failure cannot connect to saslauthd server No such file or directory RESOLVED","date":"August 6th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/08/sasl-authentication-failure-cannot-connect-to-saslauthd-server-no-such-file-or-directory-resolved/"}}
