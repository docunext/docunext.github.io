I tried a bunch of different things (tried to get http<em>host in the fcgi script, but no go) and eventually used vhost</em>alias to point to different trac.fcgi scripts using VirtualScriptAlias. It worked fine and should only require a little bit of maintenance.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Trac MySQL","date":"September 3rd, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/09/trac-mysql/"}}
