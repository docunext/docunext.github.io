{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.25em;\"><b>Lua</b></font>\nI'm having a little bit of trouble getting some traction with Lua. Its a relatively new language and doesn't have too many libraries or bindings in the Debian package archives. Since I rely upon Debian quite a bit, that makes a significant difference to me.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I do note that it is super fast. I've written a couple of shell scripts with it, and I've followed a few WSAPI tutorials for FastCGI.</p>\n<p>I also rely quite heavily on XML and unfortunately I find the XML support in Lua to be really foreign. I just don't get it. I found a suggestion on some one's blog to <a href=\"http://www.latenightpc.com/blog/archives/2006/02/06/converting-simple-xml-to-lua-tables-with-xslt\">transform XML into a Lua table using XSL</a> and that actually worked really well! I may use that technique in <a href=\"http://www.nexista.org/\">Nexista</a> instead of running SimpleXML functions over and over.</p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.25em;\"><b>Perl</b></font>\nI've really grown to like Perl. Its not the fastest language under the sun, but it is incredibly flexible and there are an incredible amount of libraries and modules out there.</p>\n<p>I just built my first Catalyst application for a client of mine and it went very well. A decent user interface and database connectivity in under thirty minutes. Talk about rapid application development! I also learned that Catalyst has an XSLT view-module. That is very very good.</p>\n<p>I've generally stayed away from MVC frameworks because they tend to avoid XML. I still plan to rely heavily on XML, but I'm impressed enough with Catalyst as an MVC to research more of them. I've tried Symfony and Ruby on Rails, so I want to try Orbit next - the Lua MVC framework.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"More Lua and Perl"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-06-11-more-lua-and-perl/"}}
