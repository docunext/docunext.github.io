{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I just setup a load balancer for my lan using <strong>pfSense</strong>. Its kind of a strange setup, because the LAN and WAN ports are on the same network, but it works. I have the LAN set to bridge with the WAN, and the WAN has a private ip in my lan, with its gateway set to the same as the rest of the hosts on the lan.</p>\n<p>Why did I do this? Well I am often reconfiguring things on my lan, such as my squid proxy-cache and my dns server, and even my database services. By using a virtual server ip address, I can reorganize things so much more easily. Thanks pfSense!</p>\n<p>Further setup details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual server ip is the wan ip</li>\n<li>Clients should connect to that ip (I use a nameserver to provide one more level of abstraction)</li>\n<li>Under Setup -> Advanced, I checked \"suppress arp messages\", as well as \"sticky connections\". Sticky connections keep a connection through the load balancer on the same ip in the pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"pfSense local load balancer"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-09-06-pfsense-local-load-balancer/"}}
