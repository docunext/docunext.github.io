From there I updated some non-essentials, like gzip, tar, and screen. Updates are going smooth, so I may upgrade postfix soon. It's currently 2.2 and I'd like to use 2.3 for its tarpit capabilities.</p>\n<p>On \"megaBSD\", the new machine I built using a Gigabyte motherboard, 8GB of RAM, and an AMD 64 4600+, the operating system in RELENG<em>6</em>2 amd64, using on board nve0 ethernet, DHCP, no hostname setup yet. So far I used cvsup to sync sources, then followed the instructions at FreeBSD.org to rebuild world:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\"># make buildworld\n# make buildkernel\n# make installkernel\n# reboot</pre>Then after the reboot, I followed suit with:\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\"># shutdown now\n# mergemaster -p\n# cd /usr/src\n# make installworld\n# mergemaster\n# reboot</pre>\n<p>Though not in the FreeBSD guide, I used the first command shutdown now because I forgot to use boot -s at the prompt. Also, I'm not sure if I had to cd /usr/src/, but I figured it couldn't hurt.</p>\n<p>Somewhat unrelated, I'm using two SATA300 drives in this machine, and one was labeled ad4 and the other ad10. Due to how the installer orders them, I thought ad10 was first, so I installed on it. The bootloader was confused when I tried to start, and I'm sure it would have been possible to load from ad10, but I just installed again on ad4 and it worked fine.</p>\n<p>So far, the machine is very fast, but quite power hungry. Idles at about 80 watts, and rises to 140 under heavy load. Amazing what a range of power consumption it has. No big deal, I won't be running it all the time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Freebsd2 megaBSD and clark gentoo progress","date":"July 23rd, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/07/freebsd2-and-clark-gentoo-progress/"}}
