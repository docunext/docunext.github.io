{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Very good Rails and Merb, looks like you've rolled a winner with Rails 3! Especially when it comes with the modularity to use various template engines and ORMs.</p>\n<p>So far I'd seen it possible to switch between haml and erb for templates, and ActiveRecord and Datamapper for ORMs. Today I learned about using RSpec for testing, and factory_girl for fixtures, too.</p>\n<p>And just now I've learned about the ability to switch from Prototype.js to jQuery.</p>\n<p><em>That is awesome.</em></p>\n<p>Nothing against Prototype.js, I just have strong skills with jQuery, and I really like its style.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/lleger/Rails-3-jQuery\">http://github.com/lleger/Rails-3-jQuery</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Devise and Mongoid</h4>\n<p>Here's another example Rails 3 app on GitHub; this one uses Mongoid for data storage and Devise for authentication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise\">http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've used Mongo with great results with Sinatra, but I've never even used it with Rails, so I'm excited to check it out.</p>\n<p>Devise seems flexible, and I like that it is apparently built with (on top of?) Warden, which is an authentication system built as a piece of Rack middleware - cool!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Modularity of Rails 3","date":"October 15th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/10/the-modularity-of-rails-3/"}}
