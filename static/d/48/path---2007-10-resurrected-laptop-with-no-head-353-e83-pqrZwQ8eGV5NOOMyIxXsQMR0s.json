After battling with trying to get it to work as a laptop, I gave up, removed the screen, keyboard, and now I'm just using it as a local development server. So much better! It consumes only a little power, but has a nice 2Ghz Pentium M in it which I can also use as a distcc node. Debian is perfect for this purpose, and I'm upgrading to lenny now so I can try out some of the newer packages like php5-xcache and mod_defensible.</p>\n<p>This is a Toshiba 5205-s703. It has an NVIDIA GeForce 460 graphics card in it so I'm able to power a 1680x1050 pixel monitor with decent performance. Works like a charm!</p>\n<p>I have another laptop I'm going to resurrect as a distcc node, but it only has a Pentium 3 in it.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I've actually upgraded this machine to use Ubuntu and I'm now using it as my desktop. It is working really well! :-) See:\n<a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/2008/01/more-ubuntu/\">More Ubuntu Please\n</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Resurrected Laptop With No Head Headless","date":"October 27th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/10/resurrected-laptop-with-no-head/"}}
