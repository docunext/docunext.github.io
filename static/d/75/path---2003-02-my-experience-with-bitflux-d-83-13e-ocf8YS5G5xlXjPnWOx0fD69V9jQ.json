{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The way cmsdemo operates is very straightforward. You can move it from host to host with a couple of directives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Its path.</li>\n<li>The path to bitlib</li>\n<li>The include_dirs</li>\n<li>the path to prepend.inc</li>\n<li>The db dns</li>\n<li>You need to install the db</li>\n</ol>\n<p>AFAIK, creating a \"new\" site that uses bitlib is quite a task. Even using the shell of cmsdemo to make a new site will be an undertaking. I need to explore admin/power more before I make this step. Furthermore, I do  believe it is wise to strip down cmsdemo, create an entirely new version of it, complete with new interface, then try one from scratch.</p>\n<p>Now, a few weeks later, I'm finding that the admin console, bitlib, and the cmsdemo are tightly integrated unfortunately. I don't see why the admin is part of the cmsdemo, well kind of I do. It appears the best way to create a site using bitflux is to use the existing hierarchy, xsl, xml, etc, and tailor it for your needs. Its really a tight system and if I designed the interface myself, I would probably do it the same way. My first experience building my own site using bitflux was fun and easy. How can you beat that? The first problem I ran in to involved the structural capabilities they have given the tool. I wanted to include a picture along with the sub section navigation panel and it seems like that will be a tough one. However conceptually it doesn't seem that bad, and over the next few weeks I will keep working on it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Experience with Bitflux","date":"February 18th, 2003"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2003/02/my-experience-with-bitflux/"}}
