Awesome!</p>\n<p>I emailed right away:</p>\n<blockquote>\"\nHi Andreas,\n<p>I'd been looking for ftp proxy and when I found it several months ago I\nwas thrilled. I noticed it hadn't been updated in awhile but I tried it\nout anyway and it did what I needed it to: proxy FTP users to different\nbackend FTP servers based upon username, much like perdition does for IMAP\nusers.</p>\n<p>I just noticed you've published two new releases and wanted to thank you\nfor continuing to maintain the code.</p>\n<p>I'd like to make a suggestion and help implement it if I can: provide\ndifferent backend mapping methods for selecting which backend to connect\neach user to.</p>\n<p>Perdition supports 1-to-1 mapping, but also supports regular expression\nmatching. Another possibility would be a CDB hash database for super fast\nlookups.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for protecting this great project from bit-rot!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Albert\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The REAL FTP Proxy is Alive and Well","date":"October 30th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-10-30-the-real-ftp-proxy-is-alive-and-well/"}}
