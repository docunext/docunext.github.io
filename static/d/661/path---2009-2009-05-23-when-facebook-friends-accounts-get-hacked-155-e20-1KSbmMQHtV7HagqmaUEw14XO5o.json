However, seeing how Facebook makes it easy to \"stay logged\" in, perhaps they should use a two stage login process like banks do, and display a picture or a phrase chosen by the user to prove that they are really logging into Facebook and not an imposter site designed to snatch up credentials.</p>\n<p>My gut is now telling me that fly-by-night website imposters are going to become more and more prevalant, and as such, DNS is going to become very very important!</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When Facebook Friends Accounts Get Hacked","date":"2009-05-23T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-05-23-when-facebook-friends-accounts-get-hacked/"}}
