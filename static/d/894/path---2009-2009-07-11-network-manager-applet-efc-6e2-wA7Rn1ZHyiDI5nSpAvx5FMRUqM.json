{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Wow! The Network Manager software package got way better recently!</p>\n<p>A little background - Network Manager is an graphical user interface\nopen source network management application which can help users connect\nin a variety of ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Wired</li><li>Wireless</li><li>Virtual Private Networks</li><li>Mobile Broadband</li></ul>\nI'd previously used Network Manager and the nm-applet tool to connect\nto some open wireless networks, but initially had to manually edit the\nwpa_supplicant.conf file for WPA secure wireless networks. Eventually I\nwas able to manage WPA networks with nm-applet, but it took some time\nto get there.\n<p>Just recently, nm-applet got an upgrade which in my experience is\nworking <em>really</em> well. I'm using it to connect to a variety of\nnetworks, and everything goes super smooth. I'm very excited about the\nmobile broadband connectivity - what a surprise! I'm connected with it\nas I type this. You know it: <b>vzw3g</b> rocks! :-)</p>\n<p>I'm also very interested in the VPN connectivity. I've previously used\nsuch a setup with Mac OS X, but never on GNU/Linux. I've manually\nconfigured IPSec on GNU/Linux to connect to a pfSense IPSec machine on\nthe other end, but in those instances both systems had multiple\ninterfaces, and public and private address space.</p>\n<p>That's all besides the point though, the \"Add\" VPN configuration is disabled for me. :-(</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Network Manager Applet"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-07-11-network-manager-applet/"}}
