{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As I make my way with Ruby, I'm finding that I <b><em>really</em></b> like it. There are many out there who feel similarly - cool!</p>\n<p>So I'm revisiting the Ruby framework I started way back when called <a href=\"http://www.neotoyz.com/blog/\">NeoToyz</a>. Its far from being usable (basically all it does is render XSL templates), but its a good way for me to learn Ruby in a more in-depth manner.</p>\n<p>Note - many Ruby users are familiar with the MVC development process thanks to Ruby on Rails. However, NeoToyz is far from an MVC. Its more of an XSLT pipelines processor.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are some awesome libraries for Ruby and XSLT, like Nokogiri and Hpricot.\nÂ </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NeoToyz","date":"August 5th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-08-05-neotoyz/"}}
