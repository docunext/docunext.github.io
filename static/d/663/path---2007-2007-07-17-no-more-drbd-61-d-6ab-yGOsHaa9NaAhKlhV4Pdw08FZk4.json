{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I stopped my highly available DRBD server setup today. The way I had it setup wasn't optimal, but it was a worthwhile effort and experiment. I had my system setup as a primary / secondary, which I don't believe is as optimal as a primary / primary setup. I found the delay time between the transfer to be slow, and recovery to be problematic with my configuration. Perhaps I set it up wrong, but it wasn't worth having two machines up 24/7.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I plan to use FreeNAS, which I believe to be incredibly stable due to the fact that it uses FreeBSD and compact flash as its OS storage mechanism.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I installed the latest version of FreeNAS today and I'm really impressed with the improvements over just the last beta version (I think they may have even <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/19/freenas-on-a-asus-terminator-c3/\">fixed the NFS bug</a>). Its a terrific product, if you haven't tried it - download it today! Another thing I noticed in the newer version of FreeNAS is that the console sets up the LAN ip to have an IPv6 address - I gotta try it out. I've been meaning to start using IPv6 but hadn't had a good excuse yet.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No more DRBD","date":"2007-07-17T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-17-no-more-drbd/"}}
