{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm totally engrossed with Ruby these days, so I'm thinking about switching to Ruby instead of PHP. I'll probably use Sinatra as the development framework.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Now that I'm working full-time as a <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Ruby on Rails</a> developer, that is my number one focus. While I use numerous versions of Rails at work (1.x, 2.x, and 3.x), I mainly use Rails 3.1 in my open source work.</p>\n<p>As such, I've researched open source forums in Ruby on Rails (as engines) and I've found Forem, by Radar. It claims to be the best forums software, ever, and it just might be.</p>\n<p>Actually, its pretty simple, but that's what I like about it! So I'm not sure what will happen to PhunkyBB. I'll probably try to port some of the useful yet missing concepts of PhunkyBB into Forem. Actually I already started - I added a position column for acts_as_list positioning of forums within a category when I ported the <a href=\"http://www.neocarz.com/\">NeoCarz</a> forum to Forem.</p>\n<p>I'll keep the content from PhunkyBB around for historical purposes (I don't like to let open source projects to bit-rot), but I'll merge it into one of my other sites, probably <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">Docunext</a>. A couple other ventures I poked at have ended up at sub-domains there - at least I'll save the $10 per year domain registration fee!</p>\n<p>I'll also likely switch to using Jekyll as the content manager for PhunkyBB. That or Middleman.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Ruby Port of PhunkyBB","date":"April 28th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-04-28-a-ruby-port/"}}
