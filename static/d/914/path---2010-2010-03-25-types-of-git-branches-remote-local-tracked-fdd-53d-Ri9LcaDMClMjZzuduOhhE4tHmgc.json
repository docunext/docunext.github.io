{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Git continues to amaze me. Yesterday I learned about \"tracked branches\", sometimes also referred to as tracked remote branches.</p>\n<p>I've been using git for several months now and am comfortable with the idea of cloning, forking, and to some degree merging. I felt like something was missing in terms of keeping up to date with \"upstream\" - the tree which was originally cloned.</p>\n<p>The idea of tracked branches is sort of filling in the gap for me. I'm using it to keep a local copy of another remote and actively developed source repository. In doing so, the task of trying to keep my tree and the other tree relatively in sync has become a lot easier.</p>\n<p>For example, last night I brought in some changes from deadlyicon's tree of git wiki. A lot has changed in both our branches from the original git-wiki source from sr. I tried:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit pull deadlyiconupstream master\n</pre>\n<p>It failed miserably, so I reset my tree to the head of the origin:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit fetch origin\ngit reset --hard origin\n</pre>\n<p>I tried creating a new branch and then pulling the the deadlyicon upstream into it, but for whatever reason it kept propagating into my master. Thankfully I found this page on <a href=\"http://www.gitready.com/beginner/2009/03/09/remote-tracking-branches.html\">remotely tracking branches</a>. It didn't explain exactly what I was trying to do, but very close.</p>\n<p>To do what I wanted, I added a new remote pointing to the other branch:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit remote add micahbrichgwups git://github.com/micahbrich/git-wiki.git\n</pre>\n<p>After that, I fetched the remote ref:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit fetch micahbrichgwups\n</pre>\n<p>Then set a branch to track it:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit branch --track mb micahbrichgwups/master\n</pre>\n<p>If I have other repositories which I want to get up to date, I can do this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit checkout -b mb\n</pre>\n<p>Actually this causes a \"branch already exists\" error, so I'm just using this:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit checkout mb\n</pre>\n<p>Though I'm not sure what the difference is between that and the <a href=\"http://www.gitready.com/intermediate/2009/01/09/checkout-remote-tracked-branch.html\">command gitready</a> suggests:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\ngit checkout --track -b mb\n</pre>\n<p>Maybe its combination?</p>\n<p>Still more to learn!!!</p>\n<h4>UPDATE</h4>\n<p>One more time for review:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nuser@dev-48-gl:/var/www/dev/movabletype-stuff/mt-plugin-tidings$ git remote add upstream http://github.com/sixapart/mt-plugin-Tidings.git\nuser@dev-48-gl:/var/www/dev/movabletype-stuff/mt-plugin-tidings$ git fetch upstream\nremote: Counting objects: 30, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.\nremote: Total 24 (delta 10), reused 0 (delta 0)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (24/24), done.\nFrom http://github.com/sixapart/mt-plugin-Tidings\n * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master\nuser@dev-48-gl:/var/www/dev/movabletype-stuff/mt-plugin-tidings$ git branch --track upstream/master\nBranch upstream/master set up to track local branch master.\nuser@dev-48-gl:/var/www/dev/movabletype-stuff/mt-plugin-tidings$\n</pre>\n<p>Nope, that doesn't work. What am I doing wrong here? Ah, I need a name for the branch (I think)!</p>\n<p>Like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nuser@dev-48-gl:/var/www/dev/movabletype-stuff/mt-plugin-tidings$ git branch --track ups upstream/master\n</pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Types of Git Branches Remote Local Tracked","date":"2010-03-25T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-03-25-types-of-git-branches-remote-local-tracked/"}}
