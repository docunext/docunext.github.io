{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Wordpress is good software, and so I'm looking into bbpress, the new forum software from the same developers. So far, I'm really disappointed. I expected Wordpress integration, and while possible, its not there. I did get it to work for <a href=\"http://www.informedbanking.com/\">Informed Banking</a>, and was constantly wonder why the two are seemingly so different when it comes to the basics, like cookies, login, and user info.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2006/09/simpler-integration-with-wordpress/\">\"Simpler integration with wordpress\"</a></p>\n<p>What really blows my mind is the difference between themes. Thinking you can use your Wordpress theme with bbpress? Forget about it.</p>\n<p>So it makes me wonder why bbpress is being developed, with existing, mature, and free packages like phpbb2 and vanilla easily available?</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"bbpress themes","date":"December 23rd, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/12/bbpress-themes/"}}
