{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This took way longer to figure out that I would have liked, but oh well.</p>\n<p><b>The Goal</b>\nSetting certain client windows to appear in all tag selections. This is also referred to as \"show on all workspaces\".</p>\n<p><b>The Solution</b>\nI first tried to figure out how to specify that an application class should be associated with multiple tags, but I was never able to do so. I finally found an rc.lua file which contained the information I needed. I put this right after the \"layouts\" section:</p>\n<pre>stickyapps =\n{\n    -- by class\n    [\"x-terminal-emulator\"] = true\n    -- by instance\n}</pre>\n<p>And this right after the \"Check if the application should be floating\" section:</p>\n<pre>    -- Check if the application should be sticky\n    if stickyapps[cls] or stickyapps[inst] then\n       c.sticky = true\n    end\n</pre>\n<p>UPDATE: Doh! This doesn't seem to work for the version of awesome in Debian's sid. :-(</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Awesomewm Sticky Windows Solved","date":"July 12th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-07-12-awesomewm-sticky-windows-solved/"}}
