For some reason, even though recent releases of gemcutter, like 0.5.0 require rubygems 1.3.6, I only have rubygems 1.3.5.

That didn't do it either, I needed to do this, too:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nrm -rf /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1/\n</pre>\n<p>After all that, I again tried installing gemcutter and in went ahead and installed 0.5.0. That's clearly not compatible with rubygems 1.3.5 so it just shouldn't install.</p>\n<p>So, indeed, if I want to use \"gem push\", it appears I have to keep ruby 1.8.</p>\n<p>More information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/upstream-devs.html\">http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/upstream-devs.html</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"GEM HOME gem path ruby gems path gem push","date":"March 26th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/03/gem-home-gem-path-ruby-gems-path-gem-push/"}}
