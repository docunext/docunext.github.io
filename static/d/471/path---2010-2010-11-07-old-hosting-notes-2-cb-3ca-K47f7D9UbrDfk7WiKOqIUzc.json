Then review our costs (mostly bandwidth and hard-drive space). Finally decide what hosting packages to offer.</p>\n<h1>Marketing mix: product, price, promotion, placement</h1>\n<h1>Sales</h1>\n<h1>Setup server(s)</h1>\n<p>*Note that 1Mbps transfers aprox 324GB/mo (both directions)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>MARKETING</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared hosting - cPanel, email, web, ftp, ssh?, one domain per account</li>\n<li>Price: $24.95 premium bandwidth, power, monitoring</li>\n<li>Promotion: discounts, direct sales, referrals, advertisements</li>\n<li>Placement: online, mailings, yellow pages</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>SALES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertise special product offerings on www.webhostingtalk.com</li>\n<li>Current clients and contacts</li>\n<li>Local businesses -  Great revenue and awesome clients.</li>\n<li>Family and Friends</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>SETUP</strong>:</p>\n<p>We need a website, integrate with a shopping cart and credit card processsing ability (ecommerce - 2checkout.com might be a cheaper alternative for now). Orders can be setup manually for now, I don't think we need an automated system at this point.</p>\n<p>The server itself, would have CentOS or a comparable distro on it that's free. We want a decent supported lifetime. Once installed, and we have the IP address that it's going to go on. We then purchase the cpanel license (based on IP) and install cpanel.</p>\n<p>Since we will be hosting budget customers, I don't think we need to go all out on DNS servers. This can be done on the hosting machine, we just need two IPs for the nameservers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Old Hosting Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-11-07-old-hosting-notes/"}}
