Not sure how I got away with that omission for so long, but at least its fixed now. :-)</p>\n<p>Without further ado, some links:</p>\n<p><a  rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter\">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GoogleSitemapPlugin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GoogleSitemapPlugin</a></p>\n<p>Next up:</p>\n<p><a  rel=\"nofollow\"  href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MySqlDb\">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MySqlDb</a></p>\n<p>(Before I convert my trac db's to mysql, I'm going to convert my main webserver, the one that powers this site, to use fast_cgi instead of using a php module.
