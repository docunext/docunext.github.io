Its less than $100, takes cheap ram, and has a pci slot for an extra nic.\n<p>Combine that with a mini-box m300 ($60), a stick of ram ($30), a compact flash card ($25), a power supply ($50), and the extra nic ($25) and you're in great shape for a couple hundred bucks.</p>\n<p>If energy consumption is a big deal, then this probably isn't the right machine for you, as it uses about 25 watts of power. </blockquote></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board.html\">More information about the intel d201gly</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"intel d201gly as a m0n0wall router","date":"July 10th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-10-intel-d201gly-as-a-m0n0wall-router/"}}
