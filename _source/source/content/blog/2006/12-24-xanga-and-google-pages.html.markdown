Trying out a couple of free online services, neither of which really seemed that great. Xanga is a MySpace / Friendster type of thing, and Google pages is a website editor.

<strong>Google Pages</strong>
I can't seem to figure out why they would bother releasing something so lame. There are many online web editors, and this one doesn't even measure up to most. My guess is that they'll discontinue it before long.

However, Earth, Sketchup, and Picasa are all very nice pieces of software. If you have a moment, definitely check them out.
