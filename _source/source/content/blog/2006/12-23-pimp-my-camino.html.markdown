Sweet! My favorite browser, Camino, has more support than I knew! I just found pimpmycamino.com, which hosts icons, scripts, and add-ons for Camino. Unfortunately, I still can't find a version of the Google Toolbar supported by Camino and it doesn't look like its possible. :-(

Camino is the Mac OS X native version of Mozilla, which Firebox is based upon. It is native in that it has a direct connect with Apple Macintosh's keychain, and also uses Apple Macintosh's Quartz text rendering system. It also features some great features like ad blocking.
