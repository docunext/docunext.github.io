Minicom is a terminal tool to connect through a serial port, like to a Cisco router or switch, from a linux machine. I just got connected, and I'm already a fish out of water. I think the Cisco os is called ios, so I guess I'll have to find a tutorial for that. I'm interested in it because I want to setup a VLAN.

Found one:
