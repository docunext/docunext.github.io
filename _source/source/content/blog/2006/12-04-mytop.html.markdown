Mytop is a "top" like utility that allows you to see mysql processes. I learned about it form the MySQL Best Practices video Google hosts.

First thing that surprised me about this is that you can't get help with mytop -h, but it was easy enough to get the info from the above link. You have to supply user credentials and database selection when calling mytop. Once its started up, its very similar to top, and I can see that this is going to be a very useful tool. Thanks Jeremy!
