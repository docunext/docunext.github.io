This is a song I remied for a Creative Commons contest, remixing <a href="http://opsound.org/artist/bmrelocationprogram/">Superego by BM Relocation Program</a>. My remix wasn't selected, but I did get a free t-shirt! I'd love to know what you think: [kml_flashembed movie="http://www.docunext.com/blog/singlemp3player.swf?file=http://www-sa.evenserver.com/s/img/2006/12/superegoremix_all.mp3" height="20" width="400" /]

This song incorporates not only parts of the original, but also included several <a href="http://www.oyez.org/">OYEZ</a> samples, which are released to the public domain.
