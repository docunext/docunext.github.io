Here's a current snapshot of Nexista. Since Joshua pulled it from Tigris, I continue to use it. I've changed the code and direction around a little. <del>nexista-0.1.beta.tar.bz2</del>

If you haven't used Nexista in the past, it doesn't make much sense to download it unless you want to examine the code. Its fairly challenging to use it only because the configuration is fairly sophisticated and requires guidance. Unfortunately, that needed guidance does not exist at this point.

Change notes: * Removed a bunch of the libraries that were installed with it, including metabase. * Added a bunch of modules and actions.

UPDATE November 20, 2007: I removed the dead link to download the snapshot. Instead go to the nexista site. I also updated those links.
