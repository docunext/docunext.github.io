I just setup a MyDNS server, and was amazed at how easy it was. I've used the DynDns service for years, and grew to enjoy its simplicity. I also used Network Solutions and GoDaddy's DNS services, but these are limited to their registrar service. If you move the domain away from those registrars, you lose your DNS settings.

MyDNS is specifically designed for use with a database, so that you can enter and update domain entries easily. I installed the server based upon instructions at HowTo Forge:
