Nexista is a PHP framework written by yoga-master Joshua Savage. He's since stopped working on it and I continue to use it. I'm planning on continuing the development of Nexista, though in the near term I may end up trimming it down a bit to make it more simple than it already is.

From there I'd really like to create more documentation, and a sample site. However, I just don't have time for that right at the moment. Hopefully soon.

Here's the info Joshua had put together:
