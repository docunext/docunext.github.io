Oh yes, there's more! Let's make this easy. Use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird instead of Outlook</a>. Mac Mail will also work, but its not cross-browser compatible, or free.

Among other great features, Thunderbird includes:"<strong>Junk Mail Filters</strong>    Each email you receive passes through Thunderbird's leading-edge junk mail filters. Each time you mark messages as spam, Thunderbird improves its filtering so you can spend more time reading the mail that matters. Thunderbird will also use your mail provider's spam filters to keep junk mail out of your inbox.

<strong>Anti-Phishing Protection</strong>    Thunderbird protects you from increasingly common email scams—also known as “phishing”—which try to fool you into handing over your passwords and other personal information. Thunderbird will tell you when it thinks a message might be a scam.

<strong>Advanced Security</strong>    Thunderbird provides enterprise and government grade security features including S/MIME, digital signing, message encryption, support for certificates and security devices. Attachments are never run without your express permission, protecting you from many worms and viruses."

Please, ditch Outlook. While this page focuses on defending against spam with mail clients, I'll be writing an article on email advice very soon. <center>
