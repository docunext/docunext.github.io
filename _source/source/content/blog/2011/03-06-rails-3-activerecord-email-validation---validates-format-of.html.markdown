      At Rails3 example you've missed close paren. Anyway, works great. Thanks!

In Rails 3, the validates\_format\_of is deprecated. I sometimes get annoyed with all the deprecation that goes on with Rails (and Ruby, to a lesser extent), but this one is not a big deal, and the newer way is better, IMHO.

The old way:

<pre class="sh_ruby">
  validates_presence_of :email
  validates_uniqueness_of :email
  validates_format_of :email, :with => /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i, :on => :create
</pre>

The new way:

<pre class="sh_ruby">
validates :email,
            :presence => true,
            :uniqueness => true,
            :format => { :with => /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/i
</pre>
