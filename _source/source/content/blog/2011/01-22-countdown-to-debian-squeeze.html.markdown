#### Debian is the Universal Operating System

How cool is this... Debian Squeeze is on its way towards official release!

Debian Squeeze is currently in the "testing" phase, and will be the successor to Debian Lenny, currently the "stable" version of Debian.

It has been "frozen" (meaning that the only changes should be bug fixes) since August 2010, and is set to be released within the first or second week in February 2011!! W00t!

The next "testing" version is dubbed "Wheezy", named after another character in the very cool movie: Toy Story.

Here's a great big **THANK YOU** to all the talented, hard-working, and dedicated Debian developers and volunteers. In my humble opinion, you are all doing a terrific job!
