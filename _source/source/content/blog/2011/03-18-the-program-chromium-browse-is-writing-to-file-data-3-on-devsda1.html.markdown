The main problem I have with Google's chromium browser is how much it writes to disk **ALL THE TIME**.

Seriously, is there any way to reduce Google Chome's disk activity??

Besides Google's chrome, I feel like my laptop is nearing cooler pastures. Right now, the fan is on all the time, and its just too hot.

I just noticed - on Ubuntu Maverick, laptop-mode-tools is not installed, it uses pm-utils and acpi-support. I just installed laptop-mode-tools, hopefully it will help!
