I am trying out git svn and its working OK, but I've hit a snag (not a show stopper): I can't get my svn credentials to use GNOME's session manager.

Otherwise, I am also a little annoyed that I can't dcommit to the subversion repository if there are unstaged changes to the current tree. As a stopgap measure, I am simply stashing my changes until I make the dcommit.
