I went searching for noteworthy Rails 3.1 gems and engines recently and found these to be very interesting:

* [active\_reload](https://github.com/paneq/active_reload) - am using it now, but haven't noticed a difference yet.
* [draper](https://github.com/jcasimir/draper) - decorators for rails3! I am using this as well, and find it to be useful, but a bit clunky compared to the usual elegance of ruby and rails.

I want to try these out:

* [paper_trail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail) - an improved versioning gem
* [forem](https://github.com/radar/forem)
* [high voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage)
* [css2buttons helpers](https://github.com/thetron/css3buttons_rails_helpers)

UPDATE: I've tried out high voltage - its great! Very simple and easy to use. I'll have to sift through the source code and see what more I can find out about it.

UPDATE 2: I've also tried out forem and found that I really like it! I'm using it on the [2012 Presidential Election](http://www.2012-presidential-election.info/network/) site, and plan to replace the forums I'm built myself for [FathersWork.com](http://www.fatherswork.com/).
