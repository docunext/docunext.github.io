Seriously, who is going to call me up and tell me I've won ten thousand dollars?

I've seen it on [television](http://www.soggyblogger.com/)... you know - when the one millionth customer checks out and balloons fall from the ceiling? Apparently Apple has something similar for their app store - when the 10 billionth app gets downloaded.

The customer who downloaded the 10 billionth app gets awarded ten thousand dollars! Who knew?

Anyway, according to CNET, the household who won received the call, and promptly hung up, thinking the call was some B.S. telemarketer. Ha! Thankfully, Apple called back.
