I'm trying out Travis CI for [Regdel](http://www.regdel.com/) and it is awesome! I'm also using it for rack-xsl, and I finally got that to pass.

It took me thirteen tries to get rack-xsl to pass, but that's because my current workstation isn't setup to test it.

What does the CI stand for? Its means continuous integration, and it is a big help when rapidly developing software.

I have hit some stumbling blocks:

* Gems that are from git repositories, like rails-3.1. I had to create local copies of them and then add all my vendor/cache gems to the git repository. Yuck.
* Travis-ci doesn't seem to like bcrypt_ext.

My next step will be to try and setup a Travis CI server for private projects.
