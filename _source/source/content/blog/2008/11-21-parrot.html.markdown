Parrot is definitely a new paradigm for interpreted software. Simply put, it separates the parser from the low-level virtual machine (LLVM), so theoretically it will be possible for it to utilize and engage multiple languages.

Perl 6 will be the first language it can parse, and it is actually the "official" language of parrot.

Its still some ways away from replacing perl5, but there have already been several projects started to parse other language syntaxes, like Plumhead, which tried to get PHP to work on parrot.
