My favorite SMTP server is Postfix. I've been using it for over five years and its never let me down. I've used it on Gentoo and Debian, and still do today.

I setup the following features:

* UCE Controls
* SASL Authentication
* Virtual domains and mailboxes
* Maildrop transport for Spamsasssin integration
* Backup MX servers as relays

All in all, its awesome!
