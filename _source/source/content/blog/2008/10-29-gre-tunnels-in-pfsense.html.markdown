The next release of pfSense will supposedly include GRE tunnel capabilities, which is going to be great.

What is the use of GRE tunnels? They are similar to IPSec tunnels, but do not include encryption. That is fine for already public, non-encrypted services, and should result in lower overhead for the firewall.
