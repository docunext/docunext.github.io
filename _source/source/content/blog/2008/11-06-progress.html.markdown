I've made some good progress on PhunkyBB over the past few days. Nothing new, but a lot of fixes, and some subtle improvements.

We're still quite a ways away from a stable release, so beta testers are welcome! Feel free to checkout the source code from subversion and give it a go. There aren't any up-to-date instructions, so you'll want to enjoy challenges!
