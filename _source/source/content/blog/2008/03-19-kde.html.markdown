Its been years since I've tried out KDE so I'm going to give it another go. Installing on Debian Macbook now...

Done. Its cool - but I'm going to stick with GNOME/Openbox for now. I've become more comfortable with it over the past few weeks. Its good to have options though.

Even if I'm using straight openbox, I like to install GNOME, as it installs a lot of cool and helpful tools and apps, and the same goes for KDE. I'm noticing a lot of new stuff which I can even use from within GNOME. :-)
