title: Running Windmill

Today I ran windmill for the first time today on my pc using the firefox browser.  In order to get the program running you need to open up Cygwin and type the following into the command line.  windmill firefox http://testing.pbooks.org/pbooks/auth.php?nid=login. Type in the address of which ever web page you wish to test.

If you wish to run Windmill with Internet Explorer instead of Firefox, all you have to do is substitute Firefox with ie.  The rest of the command line should remain the same.

After using Windmill I think that Selenium is actually a little more user friendly.  I was unable to figure out how to save tests to specific folders or even rename tests with windmill.  Another aspect that is slightly inconvenient is the fact that you have to enter a new command line in Cygwin ever time you want to test out a new site.
