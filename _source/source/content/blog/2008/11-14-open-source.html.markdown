Open Source is one of the greatest things out there right now. I use it all the time on my personal machine.

<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">Neo office</a> is my alternative to Microsoft Word. It works almost exactly the same and as a donation based software the price is right.

<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp </a>is also a great solution for a girl who can't afford expencive name brands like Adobe Photoshop. I'm still learning how to use it, but it has never let me down for my basic needs.

One of my favorite versions of open source is the game <a href="http://www.lostlabyrinth.com/">Lost Labyrinth</a>. It's a 32 bit turn based game in a dungeon. You can pick skills, and even disadvantages, to create your character. It's a lot of fun. I've never beaten it, but one of these days I will.

I think Open Source has the ability to change the market as we know it. People will not be paying for the product, so much as they will pay for the support that goes with it. The opportunities are limitless and the global community surrounding open source is really an inspirational thing.
