Now we're up to four drivers:

<ul><li>Via - old</li><li>Unichrome - floundering?</li><li>Openchrome - progressive?</li><li>Chrome - new, limited</li></ul>

The new one, Chrome, is not to be confused with <a href="http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2008/09/01/lets-hope-for-google-chrome/">Google's Chrome</a>, and is just the video driver, no OpenGL or video acceleration. I'll give it a try since I'm a glutton for punishment. :-)
