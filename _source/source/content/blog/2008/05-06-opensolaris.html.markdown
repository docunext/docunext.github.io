I'm trying out OpenSolaris today on an intel d201gly. Hopefully the sis ethernet driver will work *bug-free* now.

Strange, I just tried using the text installer, but it just brought me to the console login.

Trying again with GUI...

Huh? Can't have usernames longer than 8 characters? Sniff, sniff? Smells like Redmond Spirit?
<h4>Results</h4>

I'm not happy with the results. The video driver was causing all sorts of distortion (happens with Debian GNU/kFreeBSD on the same motherboard), but I couldn't figure out how to change the driver - no /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and the Device Driver Manager wouldn't start.
