Reseller accounts remain a hot commodity in the hosting marketplace, but I expect to see a migration or reseller accounts from shared hosting services to virtual hosting very soon.

Virtual hosting takes advantage of a server's ability to virtualize itself into separate units, and there are many ways to do this:

<ul><li>Nexenta Zones</li><li>OpenVZ</li><li>KVM</li><li>Xen</li></ul>

The main thing needed to <del>accomplish</del> accelerate this process is an open-source reseller panel for virtual machines. This could probably be cobbled together with existing tools. I'll have to look into it.
