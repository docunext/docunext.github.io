title: RoundCube Session Error with MySQL
date: 2008-03-28

I was getting Session Invalid or Expired messages whenever I tried using MySQL - thanks to<a href="http://http://trac.roundcube.net/ticket/1484101"> this page about MySQL and time stamps</a> I was able to fix the problem, as well as correctly set the timezone on one of my servers. :-)
