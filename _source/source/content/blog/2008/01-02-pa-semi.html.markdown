I recently learned about a new chip manufacturer: PA Semi. The company has some interesting chips - they are similar to the Power PC chips that shipped in the older Macintoshes, except that they are much more energy efficient.

In a way its too bad that Apple switched away from the Power PC platform, but it could turn out to be their loss.
