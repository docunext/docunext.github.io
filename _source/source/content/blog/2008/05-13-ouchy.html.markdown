Take a few days off from reading Planet Debian, and <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">this</a> happens. Ouchy.

Note to self: <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys">This page concerning the update of weak keys may be helpful</a>.

I just added a note to that page about updating csync2 certs. I just updated mine and I also had to purge the old sqlite databases x509_cert tables manually.
