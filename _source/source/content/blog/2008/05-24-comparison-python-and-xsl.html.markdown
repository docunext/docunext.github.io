I love XSL. Its incredible standard, focused, and limited. When things don't work, they completely don't work.

After working with XSL for a few years, I've developed a few styles I like: clean indenting, well organized structures, and helpful comments.

Yesterday I realized that these characteristics I like about XSL are also present in python! I've tried a few times to start programming in python, but as a matter of convenience I keep plugging away with PHP.
