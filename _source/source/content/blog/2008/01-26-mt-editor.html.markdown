One of my favorite things about MTOS is the editor. It works better for me than any of the other ones I've tried. I spent a few hours last night separating it out from the rest of the code, and I think it should be pretty stable. The javascript and CSS is compressed and quite a mess, so I'll probably have a few more hours spent sorting that out.

I found an MT plug-in which allows the rich text editor to use FCK which is cool. That seems to be the best way to handle editors, allowing the user to choose whichever one they are most comfortable with. While javascript is a popular way to create editors, I've always felt that a Flash editor would work well too.
