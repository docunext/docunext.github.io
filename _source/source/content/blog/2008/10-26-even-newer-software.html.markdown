One might argue that software is so new, its almost a redundant to say something like "there is going to be a software rebirth", but I have to say it.

Why? I see software as approaching an event horizon, especially thanks to the internet, linux, FreeBSD, and the major players in open source software.

What's going to happen? I'm not sure, but I believe the evolution in software and open source software in particular are going to be so rapid and radical that it will be difficult to track its progress.

Are you ready?
