I've been using DSL for a little while, and my do I miss FIOS. In fact I got so fed up with DSL that I went out and signed up for mobile web from Verizon Wireless. Believe it or not, its better than DSL (but its about three times as expensive).

I'll probably get the cheapest FIOS package, which is still very fast.
