Pound is an http<b>s</b> proxy - and it works! I just started using this proxy software last weekend to route a public ip to a private ip space for an SSL enabled site. Unfortunately it will be a few years until SNI is widespread enough that we won't need individual IP addresses for each secure web domain, so until then, pound away!
