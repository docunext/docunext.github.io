Comcast is sending out news releases about their new wide-band service with information about speed. Its fast, no doubt, but really only the downstream service - up to 50mbps. Upstream is only available up to 5mpbs.

That's what I love about FIOS! I just got FIOS setup at my office and the best part about it is the 20mbps upstream.
