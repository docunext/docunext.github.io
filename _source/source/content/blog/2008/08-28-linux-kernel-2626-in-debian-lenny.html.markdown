Debian's lenny repositories are now featuring linux 2.6.26 - nice! I updated my <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2008/08/399-laptop.html">Acer Extensa EX5620-4025</a> last night, but I'm still having some issues with hal and wifi. :-(

The mini-pci-express chip is causing kernel oops, and I have no idea how to deal with that, other than submitting the error report.

Besides these issues, I've been leaning a ton about pfSense, ALIX boards, and hal in general. Good stuff indeed.
