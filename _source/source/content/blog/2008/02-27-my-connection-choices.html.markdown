When I connect to the internet, I use the following methods:
* Cellular wireless while on the road
* Comcast Cable at my office and home

I used to have Verizon DSL at my home but the price went up after the 12 month initial contract was over, and after several attempts to sign up again, I gave up and signed on with Comcast.
