title: Data Models in XSL
date: 2008-12-08

Just a quick note here (I'm in the middle of programming, don't want to get too distracted!) about a new practice I'm trying out: the design of data models using XSL to output SQL customized for different database engines.

So far I've only been working with MySQL and SQLite, but I believe it could work for many more engines. If you think this is an interesting idea, please comment on this post, thanks!

As a specific reference to what I'm describing, see the <a href="http://www.private-wiki.com/trac/browser/trunk/apps/private-wiki/data/model/private_wiki.sql.xsl">data model for Private Wiki</a>.
