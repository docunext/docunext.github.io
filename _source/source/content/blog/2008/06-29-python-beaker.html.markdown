Python's Beaker package is actually quite nice. After wrestling with sessions in perl for awhile, its refreshing to find a package that "just works".

I'll have to research SQLAlchemy some more, because I still am having a hard time working with python db-api. I get the feeling though that SQLAlchemy makes databases "pythonic", kind of like how lxml handles libxml2. I haven't bought into that concept yet, I'm a big fan of SQL "as-is", in my opinion there is no need to change it at the moment.

Chances are I'll continue with adoDB (actually its working fine for me now), then try out SQLRelay, then try SQLAlchemy.
