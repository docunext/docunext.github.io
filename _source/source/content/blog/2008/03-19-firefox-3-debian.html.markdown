It will likely appear as Iceweasel, but it doesn't matter to me. I can't wait until Firefox 3 comes out for Debian.

Its surprisingly fast compared to version 2, especially when it comes to javascript intensive sites.

From what I've read, the jemalloc memory allocated helps more on Windows, but its nice to have it on linux too.
