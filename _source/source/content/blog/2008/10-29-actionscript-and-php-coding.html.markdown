While I had written a few short lines of code in basic as a child, I didn't really dig into programming until I was in college.

I started to dabble with ActionScript, but then once I graduated, I really started to get into PHP. Its not the most sophisticated programming language, but I liked it because it was convenient and easy to get started.
