I'm giving Geany a second shot. I really like its folding mechanism, and the ability to have a shell in the same window is super cool.

I'm not crazy about it handles the file browser, but I might be able to warm up to it.

UPDATE Feb 18, 2008: Not sure what the problem is - maybe NFS related? - but I am getting strange crashes when using Geany. So its back to jEdit for now...
