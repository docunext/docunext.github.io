This news comes as a surprise to me: Rackspace is buying Slicehost!

Congratulations to the SliceHost folks, but as has been my experience with Slicehost - when big changes like this take place, I probably won't stick around.

I'm quite happy with linode, and hopefully they won't get bought by Rackspace.

With regards to Rackspace, I've never used them personally. I've heard good things, and I know that they are expensive.
