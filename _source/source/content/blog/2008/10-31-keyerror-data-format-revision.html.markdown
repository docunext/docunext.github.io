Argh! My moinmoin install on debian is dead. :-(

I get a blank page when trying to create a new page, and migration scripts won't work!

Supposedly this is a broken underlay dir problem, but how is it fixed?

UPDATE: Turns out my issue had nothing to do with updating anything - it was because my connection was going through 4 proxies before finally reaching the MoinMoin server - doh!
