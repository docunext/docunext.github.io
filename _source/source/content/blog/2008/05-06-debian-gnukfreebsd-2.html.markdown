My Debian GNU/kFreeBSD development server crashed this past weekend. :( The hard drive failed, so I built a new one. :)

Something new I learned: dpk-reconfigure module-init-tools is useful for doing stuff like loading cpufreq!

I still can't get iceweasel to work on Debian GNU/kFreeBSD i386 or AMD64. I tried iceweasel-gnome-support but that didn't help.
