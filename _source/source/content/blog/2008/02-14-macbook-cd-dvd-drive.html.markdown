I'm glad to report that the battery charged to 100% yesterday and my Macbook is back in action, still minus the CD / DVD drive. Unfortunately, the DVD drive is packed away from owner's prying hands. Its a Matshita DVD-R UJ-857. I wonder if there are instructions anywhere to replace it?

What do you know, there is! <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac/MacBook-Core-Duo/Optical-Drive-Replacement/86/9/">Installing Optical Drive Replacement</a>

I'm not going to bother with this now, but its nice to know that its possible.
