I feel like I'm finally starting to get python. After reading <a href="http://python.ie/blackmagic/">Python black magic</a>, I started to notice that there were some different ways of doing things in python. There are always different ways of doing the same thing from language to language, and even within a language in perl's case, but python has come up with its own paradigms for some common scenarios.

The real powerful stuff I see in python includes the ability to <em>easily</em> push heavy lifting off to C and the fine grained control when it comes to threads.

More notes are in the wiki, filed under <a href="/wiki/Python">Python</a>.
