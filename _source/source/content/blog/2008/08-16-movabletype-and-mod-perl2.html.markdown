I've been able to get <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Movable_Type">MovableType and libapache2-mod-fcgid to play nicely together</a>, and tonight I tried to get MovableType and mod_perl2 to work. Alas, I'm not sure it can happen:

<a href="http://codewitch.org/2007/10/mt-and-mod-perl-2.html">http://codewitch.org/2007/10/mt-and-mod-perl-2.html</a>

I gave up on this and decided to continue using mod-fcgid. It works well enough.
