title: Firefox 3 Zoomin

One of the coolest things I've found in Firefox 3 is the ability to zoom. I'm not sure if its specific to FF3, but wow is it cool. Pressing the + or - key twice will increase the display size of the web page. Not just the fonts and stuff - everything. Granted, the images get a little distorted, but from an accessibility stand point it really doesn't matter. What counts is that the small fonts are now readable. Thanks Mozilla. :-)
