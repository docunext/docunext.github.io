Of all stuff Debian, the Debian wiki is a bit of a mess. So today when I was reviewing the LDAP pages, I figured I'd give registering a try. It worked! I was able to make some minor cleanups and edits to the page, in hopes of improving its quality. Since quality is a subjective term, I made only minor changes so I don't step on anyone's toes.

I'd like to contribute to Debian, and I'm a big fan of Wikis so hopefully I can keep making improvements to their wiki when possible.
