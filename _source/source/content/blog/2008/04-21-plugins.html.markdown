Here I am again thinking about a common web application programming interface (API) for plugins. This time it has to do with email clients - could squirrelmail plugins work with circlebox plugins?

What types of plugins are we talking about anyway? Vacation auto-responders and spam filtering controls, mostly.

Plugins are further along in the <a href="http://trac.roundcube.net/milestone/0.3-beta">RoundCube roadmap</a>.
