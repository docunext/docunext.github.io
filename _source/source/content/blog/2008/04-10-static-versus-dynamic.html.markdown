I really like the idea of static content (files) rendered dynamically. I like this because there is no need to "publish", but the static files which are created can be interfaced with by the operating system and / or web server in a very efficient manner.

I have a feeling that Mutable Times would have a pretty easy time rendering data on the fly, but I'm really not sure.

The easy part for the most part is purging stale content.

No doubt about it, some web services require fully dynamic content, like <a href="http://www.phunkybb.docunext.com/blog/">PhunkyBB - a punbb fork</a>, but when possible static content is easy to manage.
