These upcoming chips both look great! I'm a fan of single core chips, and the Isaiah is looking good to me. It comes with AES acceleration, and I presume a hardware random number generator.

It appears that the Atom can achieve very low wattage - around 4 or 5 watts, but I'm guessing it will be a lot more expensive that the Isaiah (codenamed CN).
