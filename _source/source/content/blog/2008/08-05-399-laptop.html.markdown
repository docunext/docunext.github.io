I just purchased a laptop for $399 (learn more <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2008/08/399-laptop.html" title="$399 Laptop">here</a>). It came with Microsoft's Vistaster, so I removed it and installed Lenny x86_64. So far I love it!

I'm going to upload all the gory technical information to the <a href="/wiki/">wiki</a>.
