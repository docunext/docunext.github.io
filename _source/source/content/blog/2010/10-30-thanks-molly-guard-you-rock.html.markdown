Molly Guard just helped my out once again. Big thank you to the developers who created it. :-)

What is Molly Guard, you ask? It is a guard to protect big red switched from getting turned off, and it has a cool history, actually.

<blockquote class="svxlb"><pre>
[University of Illinois] A shield to prevent tripping of some Big Red Switch by clumsy or ignorant hands. Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an IBM 4341 after a programmer's toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you'll see the much less interesting description "guarded button".
