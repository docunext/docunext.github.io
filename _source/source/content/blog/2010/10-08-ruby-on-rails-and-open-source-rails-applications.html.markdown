While I'm absolutely enamored with Ruby these days, I have to admit that it took me awhile to open up to it. *Why?* Because I'm usually skeptical of hype, and there have been an abundance of **Ruby on Rails** hype.

I'm *still* a little skeptical Rails! Consequently, I have embraced Sinatra - and I'm glad I did, because in my humble opinion, it rocks! From a practical perspective, Sinatra does not have the same reach as Rails, i.e. - droves of people have heard of Rails, and that can be an important factor.

My experience with Rails is this: I've created a few test applications with Rails and support a production Rails application for one of my clients. That said, I need to brush up on my Rails.

*What should I do?* I'll look to the open source world for some open source Rails examples! Here are a few I've been familiar with for awhile:

* Radiant: A CMS
* Redmine: An Issue Tracker
* Gitorious: A Web Interface for Git Repositories
* Ovirt: A virtual machine manager
* Mailr: A web interface

These should help me learn and embrace Ruby on Rails! Still - I'll personally favor the mojo I have going on with Sinatra, jQuery, and XSL.

#### Radiant

Radiant is Rails-esque, meaning you can generate a new site skeleton, much like Rails can generate an app skeleton.

Radiant also has cool extensions like:

* Electrostatic - render pages to static files
* super_export - import/export of database to and from YAML files (would be nice to have JSON as well)

#### Redmine

This has a truly sweet interface, and is compatible with multiple version control repositories. I'm assuming its also compatible with the databases that Rails is generally compatible with: MySQL, SQLite, Postgres, etc.

#### Gitorious

Sorry, I'm a GitHub guy. I've tinkered around with Gitorious and was impressed, but felt it had some user interface issues.

#### Ovirt

Haven't used it yet, but its a virtual machine management interface.

#### Mailr

Looks cool, but why does it not support SQLite?? RoundCube does.
