Looking to enable back and forward history navigation in the browser when using AJAX to update page content in a dynamic manner.

Of course I'd like to use a jQuery plugin if I can find a good one!

Here's what I've found so far:

* <http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/>
* <http://plugins.jquery.com/project/history> (looks good)
* <http://jqueryfordesigners.com/enabling-the-back-button/>

* <http://github.com/Panmind/jquery-ajax-nav> (looks good)
