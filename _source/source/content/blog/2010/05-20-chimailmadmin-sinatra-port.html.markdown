I'm porting [Chimailmadmin](http://www.chimailmadmin.com/blog/), an email management tool I've been working on for a couple of years, to Sinatra.

Actually I'm working on porting a bunch of web applications I work on, but Chimailmadmin is the furthest along.

I'm glad I held off for a bit while I became more familiar with Sinatra. Its a really sweet little web application framework.

And yes - its open source (Affero GPLv3) and available on [Github](http://github.com/docunext/chimailmadmin)!
