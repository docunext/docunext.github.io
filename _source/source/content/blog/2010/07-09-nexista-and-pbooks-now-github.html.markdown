Just spreading the good news - the two PHP projects I work on the most, [Nexista](http://www.nexista.org/) (a web application development framework) and [PBooks](http://www.pbooks.org/) (an open source accounting web app) are now hosted at Github.

In the process, I went through PBooks and made sure the code is totally up-to-date. I've still got some organizing to do, but its a big step forward.

In the several months I've been using [Git](http://www.docunext.com/), I'm really amazed by how useful it is!
