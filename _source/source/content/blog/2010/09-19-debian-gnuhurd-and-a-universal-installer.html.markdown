Planet Debian recently featured a post by <a href="http://www.milliways.fr/2010/09/19/google-summer-of-code-2010-debian-report/" rel="nofollow">Obey Arthur Liu about the Google Summer of Code</a>.

The section about the Debian GNU/Hurd port by Jérémie Koenig especially interested me. It included work on a cross-platform [Busybox](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Busybox) port and the "de-Linux-ization" of the Debian installer, which will definitely help other ports:

* Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
* Debian GNU/kNetBSD
* Debian GNU/Minix

What about the possibility of using a different set of userland tools besides the GNU tools? Perhaps we'll see a port like this:

* Debian BusyBox/Linux

Who knows??

I also found the section about Config::Model very cool as well. I'm very interested to see how this project coordinates with etckeeper, Augeas, and Puppet.
