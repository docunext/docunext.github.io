Check out this post by Russell Coker about a "hybrid" computer / laptop:

[The Lenovo U1 Hybrid - an example of how Proprietary OSs Suck](http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/01/10/lenovo-u1-hybrid-proprietary-os-suck/)

At first I thought that hybrid referred to some sort of power system, but it refers to the operating systems which the device runs.

At first glance it seems pretty strange. I agree with Russell in that it is my personal opinion that proprietary OSs suck compared to open source operating systems like Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.
