Now that I've actually used both Redis and MongoDB a little, I have to say I really like them both a lot. In tandem with using these two, I also worked with MemcacheDB and Tokyo Tyrant. I like those too, but I want to write about Redis and MongoDB because they have substantially different features than what I've been familiar with in the past.

#### Redis

For me, the absolute most awesome feature about Redis is the native list data type. I'm already thinking about all the lists I'm going to create:

* Server logs
* Software packages
* States
* Colors
* Hardware manufacturers

Yes, I'm really looking forward to having that information readily available!

The fact that lists can be truncated makes circular logging super easy too!

#### MongoDB

Oooh... I'm not sure where to start on this. I've setup [a little blog engine on Docunext Labs](http://www.labs.docunext.com/demo/doculabsappone/news/) using MongoDB and I'm impressed! MongoDB is:

1. Fast
2. Flexible
3. Easy to use

It has a nice "vibe" to it. :-)
