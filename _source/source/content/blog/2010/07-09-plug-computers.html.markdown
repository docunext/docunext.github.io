Plug computing is really coming of age, and in my opinion - that's very cool!

#### **What is a Plug Computer?**

A plug computer is often described as a small, low-power computer that has a form factor that allows it to be plugged directly into a power outlet.

They've been around for awhile as specialty hardware. I think the first one I saw was called JackPC, and that was designed more as a computer that resembled a wall outlet than something that would get plugged into a wall outlet.

More recent plug computers look almost like power adapters, aka wall warts. The one that seems to have gathered the most attention is called the **SheevaPlug**. It runs on the ARM9 architecture and is marketed by Marvell and their system-on-chip called Kirkwood 6281.

#### **Plug Computer Power Consumption**

I've read that the SheevaPlug only uses 5 watts of power. If so, that would really be amazing because its reportedly quite a little powerhouse, too, in terms of processing power.

#### **Plug Computer Uses**

I'd first guess that a very useful application for a plug computer would be wireless - using the plug as a node in a wireless mesh network, or simply acting as a repeater node to extend wireless range.

After that, the sky is the limit! Prior to plug computers, enthusiasts have been modifying wireless routers with linux to act as micro-servers, even using some that have support for USB as network attached storage devices.

This brings up two important points about some plug computers:

* USB 2.0 support
* eSata support

The eSata support is really, really awesome!

#### **Plug Computer Pricing**

This is another important factor when it comes to plug computers: they are inexpensive! The SheevaPlug development kit can be purchased for only $99 USD!
