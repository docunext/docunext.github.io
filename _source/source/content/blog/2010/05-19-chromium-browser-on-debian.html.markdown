Its wonderful! The *open source* chromium-browser is now available on Debian. Its been available on Ubuntu for awhile, and its not too earth shattering on Debian because Google has made their Chrome browser available on Debian for quite some time, but still - how cool!

WebKit is no doubt the browser base of the future, and there are many great browser using it:

* Chrome
* Chromium
* Surf
* Midori
* Epiphany
* Arora
* Safari (Mac OS X and Windows only)

If you haven't tried any of these - you might be surprised!

Still, I'm looking forward to trying out Firefox / Iceweasel 3.6 - I think it will be much faster.
