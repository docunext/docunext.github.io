Vrome is a very interesting project! What does it do? It brings *Vim* to *Chrome*!

In fact, I'm actually writing this Movable Type Open Source-powered blog post with gVim. Seriously - it will actually launch gVim for me,
allow me to write a bunch of stuff, and then when I <tt>:wq</tt>, the text is posted into the textarea field. Wicked.

I'm not really used to the gui version of Vim, but I think I can dig it.
