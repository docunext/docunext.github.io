The hippo says welcome to CYGWIN.

CYGWIN is a port of basic UNIX utilities to Windows, allowing a wide array of UNIX software to run on it. I used it several years ago with decent success (it is Windows, after all). Now I'm using it to access git repositories from a Windows machine which I only use to run Adobe Flash.
