Sorry, but I have zero tolerance for spam, *especially* really stupid, cheesy spam like this email from Rackspace:

"Rackspace has sent you a notification. Please login into the portal or follow the

Re: Account #2055

Rackspace Hosting"

What??? The subject is "Cloud Administration Control Panel now in MyRackspace customer portal!"

Rackspace, don't email me.
