This post is about Slicehost, but the subject matter is about electronic payments in general.

I wish it were easier to make payments to a variety of vendors in a more flexible manner, without being tied to one account or another.

If you are familiar with network proxies, you might know what I'm talking about! Wouldn't it be nice to have more flexible payments by proxy??? And yes, I realize that PayPal provides am inkling of this functionality, but no, it is of no use to me.

Anyway, with Slicehost, they have options for "Make a payment" and "Update my card on file", which based upon my experience making online payments led me to believe that "make a payment" would allow me to enter in a different credit card for a one time payment. Alas, no, it was simple a manual method of charging the card on file.

Now here comes the customer support dance:

Hello,

Please do not try and charge my AMEX card for the $40 I entered. The "make a payment" option sounds like what is commonly a "make a single payment" option where one can enter in a different card than the one that is on file.

I want to keep my AMEX card on file, but need to pay this month with another card.

Please advise.

Albert
