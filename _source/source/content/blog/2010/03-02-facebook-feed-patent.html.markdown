I should probably post this in the [Informed Licensing](http://www.informedlicensing.com/) blog, but this one is about Facebook, so its OK.

I read recently that Facebook was approved a patent for the functionality they provide as part of the "wall" feed. Granted, getting approved for a patent does not indicate its validity. If I understand correctly, its little more than a filing.

However, even before the lawsuits commence, I have to wonder... didn't this exist before they filed?
