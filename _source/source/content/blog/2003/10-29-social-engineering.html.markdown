Social engineering is the process of developing a human character based on psychological and sociological principle using an engineering based methodology. It is a compelling way to trick people, but it doesn't necessarily have to trick them. It is as well a compelling way to communicate to them.

Blue Nowhere is a good book that describes social engineering.
