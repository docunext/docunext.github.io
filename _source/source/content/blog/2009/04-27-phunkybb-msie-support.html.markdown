I rarely use Microsoft Internet Explorer, but I realize that lots of other people do, so I usually try to support it as much as is practical.

When I checked the newest version of PhunkyBB with MSIE tonight, it really looked terrible. Thankfully it only took a few hours to get everything *pretty* much in order.

I've been testing on an Asus eee PC with MSIE 6.0, which obviously isn't the most common MSIE setup, but it is a good test bed because of its screen size constraints.

I also have a more recent version of XP with IE 7 on a fifteen inch laptop screen. That is a much more common setup, and I'm hopeful that it will work from the start of testing.
