I've [compiled TinyLDAP](http://www.docunext.com/blog/2009/02/tinyldap.html) before and I'm about to try it again.

<pre class="sh_sh">
apt-get install libowfat-dev
</pre>

Quite simple! Again I had to manually edit the makefile - why are there two places where DIET is set?

I can't seem to find the license for TinyLDAP, so I've joined the mailing list and inquired:

"Hello,

Are you planning to specify a license for TinyLDAP?

Thanks!

- Albert"
