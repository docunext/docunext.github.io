Thanks to Awesomewm, I found out about termit. Termit is yet another terminal emulator, but it has a Lua API for configuration, similar to Awesome.

It isn't available in the Debian repositories yet, but it only took a moment to download, compile, install and run. The Lua api looks great. I haven't used it yet, but I most definitely will. :-)
