I've been using http proxies a lot lately, combining various functionality from different web servers to create some great solutions. As my usage of proxies increases, one question that keeps popping up in my mind is how the number of web proxies effect the latency and speed of content delivery.

I'm planning on doing some tests, and since good tests require planning, I'm posting this quick entry here to solicit suggestions as well as keep my own notes on the topic. Any feedback is appreciated - thanks!
