title: Why not support SVG

I've been working on trying to get an <a href="http://www.artisticbot.com/blog/2009/07/adobe-illustrator-versus-svg-format.html">Illustrator file converted to SVG</a> (scalable vector graphics) format, and in my research I've learned that Microsoft's Internet Explorer still does not support the SVG format - even at version 8!!

Browsers powered by WebKit or Mozilla's Gecko engine all support SVG. SVG is not perfect by any means, but it is really nice for many applications, like <a href="http://www.internetfloorplans.com/">floor plans</a>, for example.
