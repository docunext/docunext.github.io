While I'm getting into Ruby, I'm also getting into Git. Examples of my interest:

* <http://www.pbooks.org/blog/2009/11/switching-from-trac-to-sd.html>

There is an awesome Ruby + Git library called Grit which provides object oriented access to Git repositories from Ruby. I'd love to see this type of access from PHP, Perl, Lua, or Python too.

In my opinion, Git is changing the rules. I'll eventually elaborate on that more.
