Dreamweaver is a great way of designing websites, it basically takes all of the guess work out of writing code.&nbsp; I am still fairly green when it comes to using the program, but I feel like I can design a pretty respectable website when it comes down to it.

I know the basics when it comes to writing code, but if I had to design an entire site using just code I would be out of luck.&nbsp; I feel like dreamweaver is a good way of designing the majority of the web site, and code is a good way of tweaking things when you need to.&nbsp; I'm still a rookie but I'm making some good progress.
