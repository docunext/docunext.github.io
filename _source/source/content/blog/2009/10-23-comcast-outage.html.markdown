title: Comcast Outage

My Comcast account in New England is currently experiencing an outage. It started at approximately 2:20AM this morning. Ugh.

<!-- 183941403 -->

UPDATE: Its annoying when one CSR tells you one thing and a different CSR tells you something else. The network was still down this morning and the CSR I spoke with today said there were no outages and that the modem needed a reboot. When one of my employees made it to the office, he rebooted the modem and it got back online. Grrr.
