I'm working on a set of standard XSL templates for web application interface markup.

They are called [1bb02b59 hosted at github.com](http://github.com/docunext/1bb02b59) and are licensed using the Apache 2.0 license, though I may switch or add the BSD or MIT licenses.

I'm also thinking about aligning up with the [web-app-theme project for CSS and Javascript integration](http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme), though that appears to be RoR-centric.

The README.markdown file:

# Standard General XSL Templates

Output Templates
