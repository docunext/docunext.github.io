Always Innovating has come out with a new netbook, a really cool one at that. It contains the Beagle Board (using the ARM9 platform), and thus only sips power. Battery life is supposedly 10-15 hours. The really cool thing about this netbook is that the screen disconnects from the keyboard and can become a tablet computer.

The other cool thing is that the USB ports are internal, so it is easy and safe to add a few gigabytes from a usb flash drive.
