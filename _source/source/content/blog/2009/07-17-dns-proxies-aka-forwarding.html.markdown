Seeing how much I appreciate caching web proxies like Varnish, I'm surprised I never tried setting up unbound as a forwarding DNS server.

Well I did just that this morning and its awesome.

I am using it for my private DNS service. It is a delicate balance of access control and availability, but I think I've got it right this time.
