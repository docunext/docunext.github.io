A few days after learning about and using the yui-app-theme CSS framework, I realized that the core YUI javascript library isn't needed for most of the cool stuff that the project offers.

Since I primarily use jQuery, I'm now thinking about how to integrate jQuery with it.

The jQuery project has the jQuery UI project, but it is mostly about widgets and stuff like that. I'm more interested in completely general layout styles.

I've spent some time studying some web document and web application structures that I found to be successful:

* Wordpress Kubrick and Kaytwo themes
* MovableType Open Source
* SquirrelMail, PhpMyAdmin, RoundCube, MediaWiki, Trac

There are some obvious patterns. Why not try and standardize them to a certain degree? Wouldn't it be nice if you could use the same theme on different apps???
