There are many types of user agents, but I'd rather not have to keep track of them all. I've been thinking about trying to keep it simple, so I've come up with these categories as an idea:

<ul><li>msie - I do not like Microsoft products</li><li>standard - I like standard compliant browsers</li><li>bots - web crawlers, w3m, lynx, etc.</li></ul>
