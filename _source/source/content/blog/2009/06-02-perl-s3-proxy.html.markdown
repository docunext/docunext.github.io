I'm surprised this isn't easier to find: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache2-S3/">Perl S3 Proxy</a>.

Too bad its Apache2 mod_perl2 specific. That's not really <em>bad</em>, but I would like to use it with NGINX too.

There is also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/Net-Amazon-S3-0.51/">Net::Amazon::S3</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~tima/Amazon-S3-0.441/">Amazon::S3</a>, maybe those could be run as FastCGI applications?
