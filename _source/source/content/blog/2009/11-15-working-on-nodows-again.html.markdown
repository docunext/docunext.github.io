I've finally found a little time to work on [NODOWS](http://www.nodows.com/) again. :-)

This means that I'm also working on mindeb! The mindeb.xml file is in dire need of a cleanup. I'm simplifying it, so that long term maintenance will be easier. I'm also going to try and keep up with the progress in debian and the linux kernel in general.
