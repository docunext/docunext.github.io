Awesomeness! Google Chrome on Debian GNU/Linux can now print. This is the last major feature I was missing.

When I use [PBooks to create invoices](http://www.pbooks.org/blog/), I'd have to fire up Iceweasel just to print them. I still love Iceweasel, but its just not nearly as fast as Google Chrome / Chromium.

Major kudos to the Google Chrome / Chromium developers!!
