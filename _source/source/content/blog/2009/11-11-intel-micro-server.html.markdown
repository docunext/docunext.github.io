Its been almost two months since the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, and I'm only now learning about a new micro server they unveiled there. Either they didn't know how cool I thought it would be, or I've been working too hard!

Here's a [press release](http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090922comp_b.htm) from Intel which includes lots of other news and only mentioned the micro server about halfway down the page:

<blockquote>Maloney disclosed a new ultra-low-voltage Intel® Xeon® 3000 series processor featuring a TDP (Thermal Design Power) of only 30 watts. To complement the broad range of dense and power-optimized platform offerings, Intel also demonstrated publicly for the first time a single-socket "micro server" reference system which will help enable micro server innovation and future specification.</ blockquote>

I hope they put these into production and make them available for purchase very soon!
