title: GitHub No Longer on EngineYard Network Now On Rackspace

Looks like Github.com has switched from using EngineYard to Cloudspace by Rackspace. At first I thought Rackspace might have bought EngineYard, but they are still around as a separate entity, complete with totally different whois records. :-)

I've heard wonderful things about Rackspace but as far as I know they are pretty expensive.

I'm surprised I've never written about EngineYard. They look interesting, but their services are also a little steep for my wallet.
