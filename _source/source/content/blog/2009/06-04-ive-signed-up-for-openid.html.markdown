      I have written a lengthy post why OpenID is awesome and why passwords are stupid recently at <a href="http://spookyet.wordpress.com/2009/05/23/passwords-are-stupid/" rel="nofollow">http://spookyet.wordpress.com/2009/05/23/passwords-are-stupid/</a><br/><br/>I'm disappointed that the best provider is closing shop. MyVidoop was/is awesome. I hope you didn't sign up with them, or if you did, you used informedprivacy.com as your OpenID URL and redirected.  If you use your blog URL as your OpenID URL and redirect you can use any provider.

Ikiwiki blogs / wikis support OpenID identity logins out-of-the-box, so I've decided to sign up for one. I had previously setup an OpenID server, but since I don't want to bother with that again right now, I just signed up with Verisign.

It was fast and easy, and I've already used it to login to one blog to make a comment. MovableType uses it too, so I'm looking forward to using it for that as well.

I'll probably setup an OpenID server again at some point in the future when I have a few more minutes to spare.

UPDATE: I'm still using Verisign, but I've changed my OpenID to use a domain I own, and then I delegate authentication to them. Its much better that way, because if Verisign stops offering the service, or I decide to use a different one, I won't have to update all the previous references to my identity. Hooray for delegation!
