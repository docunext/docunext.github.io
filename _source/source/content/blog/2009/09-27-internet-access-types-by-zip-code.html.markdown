I wish there were a database where you could lookup what internet services were available by zip-code. Does such a service exist?

Some useful resources:

* [WISP Directory](http://www.wispdirectory.com/)
* [FIOS Map](http://www.dslreports.com/gmaps/fios)
* [Wireless Mapping](http://www.wirelessmapping.com/)
