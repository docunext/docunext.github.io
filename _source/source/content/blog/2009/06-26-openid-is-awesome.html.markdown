title: OpenID is Awesome

After a few weeks of using OpenID, I've come to the conclusion that it is awesome.

I guess all I needed for some convincing was a few good applications to use it with. I have been using it with Ikiwiki and Movable Type, and its a breeze! MovableType even has a support for trusting OpenID users. What really makes it cool is that the authentication part of the process can be delegated to a different mechanism that the identifier.

I'm going to try adding OpenID support to <a href="http://www.phunkybb.com/">PhunkyBB</a> asap.

Thanks so much to the folks who dreamt this up - bfitz right?
