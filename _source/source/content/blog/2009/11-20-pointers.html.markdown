title: C Pointers

Pointers are a concept I've been introduce to while programming in C that I haven't seen in other programming languages.

I'm reviewing this section of a class on C:

<a href="http://www2.its.strath.ac.uk/courses/c/subsection3_9_3.html" rel="nofollow">Pointers in C</a>

Interesting! It sort of reminds me of local and global variable scopes in interpreted programming languages.

More specifically, C pointers really remind me of hash references in [Perl](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/perl).
