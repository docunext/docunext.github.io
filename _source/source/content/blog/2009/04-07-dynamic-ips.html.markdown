Its ridiculous that Internet service providers charge as much as they do for static IPs. So what are publishers to do?

Proxy, tunnel, or setup dynamic DNS? Most Internet service providers also include a restriction to not host public services in their terms of use agreements. I guess in that case a <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Virtual_Private_Networks">virtual private network</a> would be necessary.

I'm going to try and set this up tonight.
