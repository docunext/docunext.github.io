I have to admit I'm thoroughly impressed with Sinatra and DataMapper. [I've tried merb](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Merb), but I didn't get too far. I'm accustomed-to and pleased-with sitemap powered web applications and Sinatra fits into that category.

So what about DataMapper? DataMapper appears to have the capacity to make developing web applications a heck of a lot easier for me - even ones that rely heavily on XML and XSLT.

This is all good news for this Ruby Code Experiments blog as I'll be posting a lot more as I continue to work with Sinatra and DataMapper.
