I'm surprised that FreeBSD doesn't have more VPS hosting solutions available, but there are definitely some options.

Here's a few that looked interesting to me:

* [FreeBSD Virtual Machines](http://bsdvm.com/main/infocenter/freebsdvps)
* [RootBSD](http://www.rootbsd.net/virtual-hosting/)
* [ARP Networks](http://www.arpnetworks.com/vps) - interesting - they use KVM / Qemu
* [Quonix Networks](http://www.quonix.net/products/vps.html)
* [JohnCompanies](http://www.johncompanies.com/jc_vps.html)
* [Santrex](https://www.santrex.net/vpshosting.php) - interesting - they use FreeBSD jails

I may try one of these out sooner or later....
