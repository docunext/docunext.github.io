PhunkyBB 0.3 is taking longer than usual to release because of the multi-site functionality. There is still a lot to do in that regard, but I may decide to release an alpha version without full multi-site functionality as there is a lot of new features I want to use that doesn't involve multi-sites.

Alternatively, I may back port the functionality to the 0.2 branch - whichever is easiest!
