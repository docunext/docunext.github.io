title: I found a couple of bugs in PhunkyBB 0.3 alpha

I'm so glad I am being patient with the release of PhunkyBB 0.3! Turns out there were some fairly substantial things related to users and profiles which I had to remedy before a release.

I've almost fixed them and once I've done a little testing, it will be released. It has to be released, because I've got some more cool ideas flowing for version 0.4! :-)
