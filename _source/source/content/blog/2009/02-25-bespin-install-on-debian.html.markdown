I'm trying to setup the new Bespin file editor on linux:

<pre class="sh_sh">
apt-get install python-virtualenv python-httplib2 python-dev
</pre>

Actually looks like they take care of some stuff in a script:

<pre class="sh_sh">
python bootstrap.py
</pre>

OK, that was really impressive. Its super easy to setup. This is one very cool project. I came across it trying to find an easy way to edit text files served by a DAV server via a web browser. Sounds like it should be easy, but I haven't found a solution, yet.

Actually, this might work: <a href="http://homework.nwsnet.de/news/9132_put-and-delete-with-jquery" rel="nofollow">jQuery PUT http method</a>
