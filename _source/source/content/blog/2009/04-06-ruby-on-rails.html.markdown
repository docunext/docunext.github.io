I've had the opportunity to work on a Ruby on Rails application lately and its been fun to debug some of the code.

There is a bunch of terms I'm becoming familiar with:
<ul><li>Active Record</li><li>Active Scaffolding</li><li>Active Support</li></ul>The environments is a cool concept too. I like that there are development and production environments.
