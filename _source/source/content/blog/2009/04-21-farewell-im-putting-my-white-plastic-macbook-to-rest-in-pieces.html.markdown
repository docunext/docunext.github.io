Its true, my Macbook has finally kicked the bucket. It started with the optical drive, then it started to have issues booting, and now all I get is this out of memory error. Note: it's been running Debian for awhile, I'm not sure if XNU would ever spit out that type of error. Usually it says something about a kernel panic.I took it apart to see what was inside and took some pictures:



There is some worthwhile salvage, the battery is brand new and the power supply is in good shape. Same with the RAM and hard drive.
