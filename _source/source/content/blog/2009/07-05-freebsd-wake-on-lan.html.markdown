title: FreeBSD Wake on LAN

After reading up on Apple's Snow Leopard, I remembered ZFS - the really nice file system from Solaris which is available to FreeBSD kernels. I'd heard mention of it getting tested with FreeNAS, an embedded FreeBSD network-attached-storage appliance, so I visited their website.

While I was glad to see that ZFS is now available in FreeNAS, I was even more pleased to read about the wake-on-lan patches contributed by Tobias Reber. The lack of wol functionality in FreeBSD bugged me, and its awesome that its now becoming a reality.

Kudos FreeBSD!!
