title: XML Logical Statements
date: 2009-07-07

I've been thinking about how to write logical statements in XML. Apparently there are two (or more?) existing XML subset for rules:

<ul><li>RuleML</li><li>R2ML</li></ul>These appear more structured towards business logic, which is interesting to me, but I'm thinking about something simple, like <a href="http://ferm.foo-projects.org/">ferm (for easy rule making)</a> but in XML.

There is also MetaL - an XML programming format, but that seems to complicated for what I'm looking for as well.
