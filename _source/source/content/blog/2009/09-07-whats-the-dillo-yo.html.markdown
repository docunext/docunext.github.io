I keep trying Dillo about every six months, and its awesome to see the vast improvements each release.

Now that WebKit development seems to have slowed down a little bit, I'll probably take a closer look at the progress that Dillo takes.

I'd love to see Dillo use Google's V8 Javascript engine - how cool would that be? The combo would be crazy fast, I imagine. Unfortunately I doubt its a plug-and-play type of challenge.
