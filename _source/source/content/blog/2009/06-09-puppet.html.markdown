When I first tried puppet, I was really impressed. Then time went on and I got sidetracked and reverted to manually administering my systems.

Finally I got back on the horse today and revisited the use of Puppet for centrally administering and configuring many computers. Its a really good practice and I definitely want to keep up with it.

About Puppet:

<ul><li>Written in Ruby</li><li>Uses its own configuration syntax which is easy to learn</li><li>Is gaining in popularity as of 2009
</li></ul>
