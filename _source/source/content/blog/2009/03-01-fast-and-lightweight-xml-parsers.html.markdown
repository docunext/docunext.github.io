title: Fast and Lightweight XML Parsers

I tried out two fast and simple xml parsers today:

<ul><li><a href="http://home.vrweb.de/%7Ejuergen.kahrs/gawk/XML/">xmlgawk</a></li><li><a href="http://mkerbiquet.free.fr/asm-xml/">asm-xml</a></li></ul>
<b>XMLGawk
</b>XMLGawk is the gnu awk utility with some xml bindings. From what I've read about it, it is a little slower that binding directly to expat, but it has a much easier awkish interface.

<b>asm-xml
</b>Now this is super cool, an xml parser written in assembly! I have only tried the examples, but they seem to run incredibly fast.

The irony here is that I found these tools while searching for ways to get basic text output into XML!
