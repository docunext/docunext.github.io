I have to admit that Catalyst, the Perl MVC (model view controller) web application framework, is growing on me. I especially like that it is written in Perl, and that there are so many libraries out there available for Perl.

I'm using it as a custom contact database solution for a client, and for that purpose it has been perfect. I've been able to quickly and rapidly create something usable and maintainable.

It works with FastCGI, too!
