Its been such a long time since I've used [Squid](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Squid) that I didn't even know that there was a version 3 out!

I decided to try squid3 and then found that I was unable to use icp for some reason with squid 2.6.

I only consider squid as a forward proxy, varnish does a better job as an http accelerator, in my opinion.

But why does squid take so long to restart? Who knows? I've been using reload instead and that is **much** faster.

Squid's support for routing domains directly and through other proxy servers is awesome.
