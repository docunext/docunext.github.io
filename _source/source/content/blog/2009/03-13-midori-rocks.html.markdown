My new favorite browsers: Midori and Arora. They use Webkit and scream along. Seriously, they are fast.

Problem is that its alpha and crashes a lot. I've only been able to use it enough to like it because I built fresh checkouts of libsoup and libwebkit. There are a bunch of things I'd like to add / change about it, so it is a good time to start digging through more code!

Note: Even though it isn't crashing all the time for me, it still has some wacky behaviors.
