The latest and greatest version of Varnish, the reverse proxy cache from LinPro, is absolutely awesome. The documentation still leaves a little to be desired, but that's where the open source community comes in!

There are some exciting new features in version two of this high performance proxy server:

<ul><li>ESI processing</li><li>Back-end health checking</li><li>Fail-over via "restarts"</li></ul>There are probably more I'm not mentioning here, but these ones are very important to me. I've only been using version 2.0 for about a week, but I'm already very impressed. The fail-over system is simple and straightforward - I lightly tested it and it worked perfectly for me.
