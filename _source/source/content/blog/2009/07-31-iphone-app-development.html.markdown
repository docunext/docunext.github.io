I was wrong about the iPhone. I thought it would be a flop, but its been an astounding success.

The number of applications which have been developed for it, as well as the number of applications which have been purchased or downloaded from the App Store is incredibly impressive.

So I have to admit, beyond eating my words about the iPhlop, I have also been considering buying an iTouch so that I can develop some applications for the App Store.

I have a Mac Mini which isn't really doing much at the moment, and I've been quite interested in trying out Snow Leopard when it gets released. Hmmm, maybe after I finish paying off my term loan in a few months.
