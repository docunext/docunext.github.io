I've been using XML and XSLT for years and I was surprised that I'd never come across this website before:

<a href="http://www.xmlplease.com/">XML Please</a>

Its great! The two things it helped me with so far are:

<ul><li><a href="http://www.xmlplease.com/xhtmlxhtml">Transforming XHTML with XSL</a></li><li>XSL Whitespace management
</li></ul> I'm sure it will come in handy many more times!
