All my posts about PhunkyBB 0.3 has really got me itching to release, however, I did find a bunch of bugs recently so I'm going to do one more big push before a release.

As I stated before, I'm still going to roll out PhunkyBB on some low-traffic sites first. I haven't gotten around to doing this yet, but it will happen in a week or two.

PhunkyBB 0.3 represents a major improvement in PhunkyBB! Are you excited? I am!
