My home folder is littered with hidden files and folders. Its not usually an annoyance, but lately the number of files has grown out of control.

Many times I've thought to myself - why aren't all these configuration files in a sub-folder? That would really help keep my home folder manageable.

Well, what do you know? There is such a sub-folder and software developers are starting to use it. Its the .config folder and I learned about it when I setup the Awesomewm Window Manager.

Now, how can we get all software developers to use this folder???
