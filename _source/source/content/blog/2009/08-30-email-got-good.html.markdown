I'm surprised to admin it, but in my book, e-mail has gotten good again.

After spammers caused me way to many headaches for a few years, the amount of spam seems to have subsided a little, and with policy systems like SPF and DKIM, I can to some degree validate the email which I receive.

Also, one of the great things about email is how simple it is. It also follows a very standard format, so you should theoretically always know what you are going to get. I've been exploring a lot of different uses for email, and I'm pleased with what I'm finding:

* Blog and forum entry submission
* Reporting and notification tools
* Validation mechanisms

Could DKIM-verified emails even be used as process triggers on remote systems? Maybe....
