For my purposes, these two are a terrific match! I've been working on yet another simplified markup scanner using ragel, and since my output target is XML (primarily XHTML), libxml2 makes a great choice.

After a few hours of trying the two out together, I really like the way they fit. The code I'm writing will be released under the name "ragelmenot". The name comes from the great skateboarding video "Shackle me not" by H-Street.
