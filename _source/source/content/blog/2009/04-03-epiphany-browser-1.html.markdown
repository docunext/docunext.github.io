The Epiphany web browser is starting to get <b>*really*</b> good. Recently they added Webkit as an alternate HTML rendering engine.

Webkit continues to undergo heavy development, and I regularly update my Subversion checkout daily and rebuild the libraries. It takes awhile, but these are exciting times for Webkit!
