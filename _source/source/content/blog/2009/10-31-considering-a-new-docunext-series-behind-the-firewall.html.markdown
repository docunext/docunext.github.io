I've grappled with running public and private network services on public and private networks for many years. While my setup remains far from perfect, its really starting to take shape as a reliable and manageable configuration.

Because I feel like my situation is fairly common and that the strategies that I and many others have employed to fix the situation are poorly organized and only somewhat well documented, I'm considering a new Docunext Series called "Behind the Firewall: Public and Private Services CAN Get Along".

Some random ideas:

* What to do when your webserver wants to access a service that is hosted on itself when the hostname is defined by a public DNS record which points to a public IP address?
* How to securely *and conveniently* access a local area network from the outside?

Defining the series:

<ul><li>History - Public vs. Private, Limited IPv4 space, Local Area Networks, Firewalls, and Network Address Translation</li><li>Bridging the Divide - Virtual Private Networks</li><li>Microcosms - Using Internet Theories on the LAN</li><li>Bridging the Divide Part II - Proxies, Host Names, Tunnels, and Recursion</li><li>Security - Network Based Security, Access Control Lists, SASL, and Working with Dynamic IP Addresses</li><li>Conclusion - Looking Forward to IPv6</li></ul>
