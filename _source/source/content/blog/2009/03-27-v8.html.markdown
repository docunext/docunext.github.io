Server-side javascript is becoming a lot more prevalent, and I got to try it out today. <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/NGINX_V8_Module">I compiled NGINX with the Google V8 javascript engine</a>.

I got it to work, but that's about it. I'm wondering why it is any more advantageous that other interpreted languages? Is it faster? Easier to write? Is the code more reusable?

I like the idea, but I'm not sure why yet.
