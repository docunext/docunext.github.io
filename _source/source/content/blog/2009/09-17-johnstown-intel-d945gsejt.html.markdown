This board looks absolutely awesome. Finally a quality follow-up to the amazing Little Falls board!

Unfortunately, it costs (around $120USD) almost about twice as much as the original Little Valley ( around $65).

I'm curious, but I'll hold off on buying this. I'm more interested in getting one or both of the following (though I still have to save up for 'em):

* BeagleBoard
* SheevaPlug

Thanks for information about the D945GSEJT:
