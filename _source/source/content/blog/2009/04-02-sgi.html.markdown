I'm surprised to learn that graphics powerhouse Silicon Graphics is being sold for only $25 million dollars to Rackable Systems. I hadn't heard their name for a few years, but I always regarded them as a quality company.

I read a little into the story and learned that they have a few hundred million dollars worth of assets, but several hundred dollars worth of debt. Ouch!
