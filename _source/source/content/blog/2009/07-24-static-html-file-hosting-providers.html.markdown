Hosting is one of those services where the competition keeps on piling feature after feature and before long the service is so overloaded with junk.

Sometimes I just need a very basic hosting service - reliable, fast, and inexpensive. When I say very basic, I mean <b>very</b> basic: no scripting / dynamic page / database support.

Thankfully there are a few hosts which provide competitive pricing on exactly this type of service:

</li></ul>The prices for this service are awesome.
