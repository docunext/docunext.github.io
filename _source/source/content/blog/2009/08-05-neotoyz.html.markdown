As I make my way with Ruby, I'm finding that I <b>*really*</b> like it. There are many out there who feel similarly - cool!

So I'm revisiting the Ruby framework I started way back when called <a href="http://www.neotoyz.com/blog/">NeoToyz</a>. Its far from being usable (basically all it does is render XSL templates), but its a good way for me to learn Ruby in a more in-depth manner.

Note - many Ruby users are familiar with the MVC development process thanks to Ruby on Rails. However, NeoToyz is far from an MVC. Its more of an XSLT pipelines processor.

Thankfully, there are some awesome libraries for Ruby and XSLT, like Nokogiri and Hpricot.
