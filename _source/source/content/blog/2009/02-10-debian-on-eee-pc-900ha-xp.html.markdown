title: Installing Debian GNU Linux on the extra hard disk partition of an ASUS eee pc 900HA XP

Thankfully the drive was already partitioned nicely, I'm hoping to dual boot to start, then migrate XP to KVM if possible. There are occasional times when it helps to have an XP system available, mostly for client support.

First off, the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC">Debian Eee PC howtos are very very helpful</a>. Its not that these are 100% necessary to install debian on the eee pc, but they make it a heck of a lot easier.
