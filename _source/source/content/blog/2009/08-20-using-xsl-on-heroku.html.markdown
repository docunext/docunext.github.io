Sweet, I got Ruby to render an xslt document on <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2009/08/heroku.html">Heroku (my review)</a>. This is good!

I'm also now using <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Sinatra">Sinatra (my notes)</a>. So awesome.

I've had a tough time with Ruby and XML/XSL so far. At least the state of affairs is better than XML in Lua!
