I just installed Debian on an <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2009/01/sweet-asus-eee-pc-deal.html">Asus eee PC</a>, and I have to say that the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC">Debian eee team</a> has done a terrific job with this piece of equipment.

It would be totally excellent if there were more machines like this which could be supported in such a way.

What about FreeBSD?
