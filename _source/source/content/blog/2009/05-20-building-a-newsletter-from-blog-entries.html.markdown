I'm thinking about building an email newsletter from blog posts as an alternative to RSS feeds.

How can it be done? I'd like to use xslt to transform the XML-based RSS feed into plaintext and HTML to then get delivered. Sounds cool huh?

I just found a decent <a href="http://www.webcheatsheet.com/PHP/send_email_text_html_attachment.php" rel="nofollow">page</a> on sending multipart emails with PHP, so that should help.
