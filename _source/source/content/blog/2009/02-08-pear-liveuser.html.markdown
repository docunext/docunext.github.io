I've been thinking about using PEAR LiveUser for awhile, and I was just reading their documentation wiki when I noticed they are using reCaptcha. That's interesting...

But anyway, I'm going to give PEAR LiveUser a try. I'm wondering how easily I can hook into it from other applications and frameworks. Hopefully very easily! Even if I don't end up using it entirely, I'm sure I'll learn from the experience.
