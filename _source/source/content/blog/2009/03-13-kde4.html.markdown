After installing Arora, I decided to install KDE4 since it also uses Qt. Its very, very nice! I haven't used KDE for awhile, but this might be my new desktop environment.

I believe it is "lighter" than a GNOME / GTK+ environment, but I actually don't know too much about Qt so I'll have to do some reading up on it.

I want simpler mouse cursors though...
