 This was a nice surprise! Earlier this week I updated Google's Chrome browser on my [debian linux laptop](http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/) and it mentioned in the fine print that "--enable-plugins" would provide support for Flash.

Cool! It works! And I haven't had any problems with it on:

* YouTube
* Google Analytics
* MovableType Statistics

Now if only printing would work....
