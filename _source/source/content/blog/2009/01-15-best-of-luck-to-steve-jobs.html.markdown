Its been tough with all the rumors about Steve Jobs, and a couple pictures surfaced of him which several bloggers commented that he was looking quite aged for only a year of time passing between the pictures. Now news that Steve Jobs is indeed leaving his post as CEO of Apple is even more troubling. I hope he fares well with his health. Good luck Steve!
