I have such a difficult time throwing away old computers.

The culprit this time is a toshiba satellite laptop which a client of mine was about to discard. It was at one time a nice laptop, but it was abused by its owner, and I've since disassembled it several times.

I'm making a promise to myself though that I will remove the hard drive and RAM and then toss it goodbye. No use in keeping it at all.
