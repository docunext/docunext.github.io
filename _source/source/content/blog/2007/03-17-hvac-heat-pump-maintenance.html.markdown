I'm going to call a heat pump specialist to inquire about maintenance and upkeep of the heat pump at my office. I would like the unit to be inspected as well. I installed an electronic, programmable thermostat and have done some research on heat pumps. I need to find the filter for replacement, too.

My heat pump has an indoor and an outdoor component. I think the indoor component is where the filter is. Unfortunately, I haven't changed the filter in over a year and its supposed to be changed every month! Ouch. In addition to the filter in the heat pump, I also plan to add a filter at the inlet vent. It will be much easier to change on a monthly basis.
