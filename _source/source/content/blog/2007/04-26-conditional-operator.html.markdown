This little exclamation point is really handy. In the world of qry and xml ! means not. It's a handy tool as it allows you to create statements which exclude certain results based on how they are categorized.

So if I want everything to appear except for one group of values. I input: id!=1. That statement reads every value where the id is not 1.
