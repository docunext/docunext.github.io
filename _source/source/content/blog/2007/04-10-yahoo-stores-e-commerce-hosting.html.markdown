I helped a customer as he logged into his Yahoo Stores account to add a bit of Javascript code for tracking site visitors. We used the instructions here:

<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/edit/regular/regular-06.html" rel="nofollow">http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/edit/regular/regular-06.html</a>

to add the code to each page.

I used a similar technique to add the same traffic tracking code to their TypePad account.
