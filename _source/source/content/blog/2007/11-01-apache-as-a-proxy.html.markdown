title: Apache as a proxy
date: 2007-11-01

I've been running Apache as my caching proxy server and it seems to be running OK. I have a couple of thoughts though:

<ul><li>Can it communicate with other Apache proxy caches to share their cache</li><li>Is there a management interface (command line even?) to find out the hit / miss ratio?
</li></ul>
