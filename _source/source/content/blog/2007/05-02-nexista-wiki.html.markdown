After demoing the <a href="http://www.pbooks.org/">PBooks</a> software and getting a lukewarm response, I'm going to hold off on opening up the source until the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/2007-03-29-gplv3-saas">Affero Public License version 2 is released</a>. In the meantime, I plan to release a private wiki engine LGPL.
