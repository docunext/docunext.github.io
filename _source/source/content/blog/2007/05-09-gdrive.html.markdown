A message came through the MacFUSE mailing list containing a reference to "GDdrive". I looked it up and found this useful article:

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=121">Google GDrive is not a rumor</a>

That article was written all the way back in March of 2006! When will Google release the "G:" drive to compete with Amazon's S3 service.
