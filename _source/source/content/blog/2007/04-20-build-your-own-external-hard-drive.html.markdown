Today I built my own external hard drive. Fairly standard as far as electronics go, but still a good thing to know how to do.





Im using this hard drive to connect to the <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2008/01/16/linksys-nslu2-price-drop/">linksys nslu2 network attached storage device</a>.  I've had a difficult time getting this to work.  At first the device wouldn't show up on the computer, then we had trouble formatting it.  These are some of the steps I took while attempting to get this thing working.

Default Password - admin

IP Address - check your DHCP logs

Access through browser

Go to search, control panel, network and internet connections, then click on my network places, then click on view work group computers, and finally click on the folder labeled LKGxxxxxxx. <br>

Format drive by doing the following

Type the IP address in the browser

Username - admin

Password - admin

Go to administration

Advanced

Format disc one
