I'm amazed! Hibernate "just worked" on my ASUS Terminator C3. How cool is that!! Meanwhile, my iMac seems to be having trougble waking up...

UPDATE: It was actually "Suspend" that works, not hibernate. What's the difference? From what I can tell, suspend and hibernate are the same, but hibernate can be done faster, if it works. :-)
