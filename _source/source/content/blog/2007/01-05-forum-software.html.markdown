To complete the loop of blog-wiki-forum, I'm checking out various forum software. I've installed both bbPress and phpbb2 for <a href="http://www.informedbanking.com/resources/forums/">Informed Banking Forums</a>, but neither really impressed me much.

I'm also looking at Simple Machines forums, and possibly vBulletin. Any feedback about your experience with any of these would be appreciated. Doesn't look like either of these are available for Debian, which is unfortunate. :-(
