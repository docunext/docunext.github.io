      You'll probably be prompted for a restart after installation of MacFUSE.<br/><br/>MacFusion should be launchable after MacFUSE has been installed and recognised by your system.<br/><br/>Enhancements and bug fixes to MacFUSE and MacFusion are in the pipeline, so please bookmark <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/</a> for the most up-to-date information on installation routines.<br/><br/>We hope that you will enjoy the improvements.

      There are now many enhancements.<br/><br/>Considering the recent activity in the Google Groups and Google Code project areas for both MacFUSE and MacFusion, I should recommend a visit to the MacFusion Project Home page <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/</a> where you'll find FAQ, links and other useful information.

      Yup! I'm using the latest beta, which even includes the ability to pass command line arguments including the ability to turn off caching. Macfusion is awesome.

Looks like the newest release of MacFUSE and sshfs are all I need to turn the switch for AFP and SMB to "off". That'll be a great move!

To use MacFUSE and sshfs (you need Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger): <ol><li>Download and install <a href="http://macfuse.googlecode.com/files/MacFUSE-Core-0.2.5.dmg">MacFUSE-Core-0.2.5.dmg</a></li><li>Download and install <a href="http://macfuse.googlecode.com/files/sshfs-0.2.0.dmg">sshfs-0.2.0.dmg</a></li><li>You should probably restart now</li><li>Open the sshfs program, enter the target server address, username, and directory. After clicking enter, you'll be prompted for a password.</li><li>Upon authentication, the remote filesystem will be mounted.</li></ol>

I just found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/">MacFusion</a> (<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/MacFusion.dmg">Macfusion.dmg</a>)which looks like it has some cool gui niceties, like keychain password integration! Actually, it even has the one feature I really missed: public key!
