Netgate shipped my m1n1wall this week and I've got it connected. Now its setup time! First thing I want to do is configure the static ip wan address:


Took a minute to figure it out, I chose static, then updated. Then I clicked on the system setup to set the hostname, domain name, DNS servers, and time zone. Works great!

Even in my few minutes of working with this system, I love it. I highly recommend checking it out if you are in the market for a firewall.
