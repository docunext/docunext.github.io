I've been trying to switch to Safari after several pleasant years using Camino. Why? Only because Safari supports multiple usernames and passwords for a single domain, where Camino does not. Unfortunately, I really don't like Safari compared to the rest of Camino. Camino has better tab switching, more pleasant rendering behaviors, and better user interface widgets.

Guess I'll stick with Camino, and figure out a way to work around the username and password issue.
