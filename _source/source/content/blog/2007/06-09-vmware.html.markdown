Finally getting around to working with VMWare, very nice actually. I can see how this could really come in handy. I'm wondering why it is free though. Is it something they will charge for eventually? (The VM Fusion license I obtained for free will expire in August of this year - that's annoying.)

I got <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/vmware-fusion-and-parallels-3.html">VMWare Fusion</a> running on my Macbook and its just as good as Parallels and Q, if not better!
