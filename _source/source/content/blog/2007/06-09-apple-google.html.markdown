Wired ran a "rumors" story about a broad reaching collaboration between Apple and Google recently. I could definitely see that happening. The article mentioned .Mac, and how Apple needs to have a better "cloud computing" offer, at least to keep up with the Jones. From online backups of media files and computer settings (which would make the make more user-friendly) to better desktop search, there is a lot of things Apple and Google could do to make their user's experience better. And the work that Amit has been doing on MacFUSE could be indicative of something in that area. We'll see what happens on Monday.
