Trying to install linux on a sata raid on a asus vintage machine - mad issues! Now trying Suse - still crashed. After many failed attempts - downgraded samsung spinpoints to 150 - much better!

Didn't like Suse, now trying the alternate install of Ubuntu. Now this is something I'm familiar with - pretty much just like a Debian text install. The first time I tried making the /boot partition a raid device but that was a no go. So I made it a regulat ext2 partition and it worked fine. Upon reboot it looked great - honestly Ubuntu 6.10 is a thing of beauty.
