I just found out about <a href="http://solarphp.com/project">SOLAR</a>: Simple Object Library and Application Repository. Looks very cool, uses the model-view-controller design, and reminds me of the zend framework at first glance.

SOLAR is led by <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul M Jones</a>, who also wrote the great Text_Wiki PEAR package.
