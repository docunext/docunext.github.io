I recently learned about The Hurd while perusing the debian pakages web pages, so I read more about it at the <a href="http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/">Hurd Wiki</a>. I was curious to try it out, but it sounded a little beyond my capabilities. The wiki includes some links to available images though, so I'm downloading a couple of those to try out.
