Sorry if you tried to access docunext.com, or any of the other <em>quality</em> content hosted on our server frankling over the last approximate 12 hours. A CPU cooling fan burnt out and was causing the CPU temp to get too high, and thus forcing the computer to shut down.

Since the machine is a dual processor server, I removed the CPU that was getting too hot temporarily while I ordered new fans for everything.

Here's a picture of the culprit - AVC fan, Model DA07015B12U (70mm x 70mm x 15mm):


And a better quality version:

Here's what I bought to replace them: (5) CASE FAN MASSCOOL|FD07015S1M3/4 RTL - Retail

Item #: N82E16835150064 "MASSCOOL FD07015S1M3/4 70mm Case Fan - Retail"(1) CPU FAN ROSEWILL|RCX-Z1 RTL - Retail

Item #: N82E16835200014 "Rosewill RCX-Z1 Long life ball bearing for over 75000/hrs CPU Cooler - Retail"

The total order was $35, which is pretty darn good. Thanks again Newegg!
