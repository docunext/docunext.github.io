I decided to cancel my O'Reilly account, sending them this message:

<blockquote>You shouldn't market videos to people who can't access them. That was a bad move. I like your books though, keep on writing quality reference materials. </blockquote>

When canceling, I noticed they offer a less expensive account: $9.99 / month for access to five books on your bookshelf at a time.
