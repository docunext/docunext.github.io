      Yes, the Thecus N2100 and Linksys NSLU2 use a different ARM chip but since Debian is built in a way that it will run on all modern ARM chips packages will work fine on both devices.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the Thecus uses a chip from the IOP (I/O processor) line and the NSLU2 from the IXP4xx line.  Both are produced by Intel.

This thing looks great:

That is a link to Martin Michlmayr's blog, which I have visited many a time in my wrestling Debian onto the Thecus N2100. Unfortunately, the Thecus isn't a very green computer for what its capable of, especially compared to the alternatives for the price, like the <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board.html">little valley intel d201gly mini-itx</a> (25+ Watts), or the <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/07/alix.html">pc engines alix1c mini-itx</a> (5 Watts).

Anyway back to the Fulong, the really interesting thing is that it has a MIPS chip, like the ones you find in low power routers and stuff. I *believe* that the ARM chips found in the Thecus and the Linksys NSLU2 are compatible, in the packages can be used on both platforms, I'm not positive on that at all though. :-)

Also posted at Martin's site is this link to a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-t7XKGI8kebP22pOrg03O8w--?cq=1">blog about the Loongson</a>. They even have a screenshot of it running Windows 98 via QEMU, how cool is that?
