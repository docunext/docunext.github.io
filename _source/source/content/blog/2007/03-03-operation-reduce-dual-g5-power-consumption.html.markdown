Dumbfounded by <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302439" rel="nofollow">how much energy is consumed by a dual-G5 PowerMac</a>, I've decided to do everything I can to reduce its energy consumption.

Some folks have converted their G5 cases to x86:

I definitely do not want to do that! Instead, I'll just do everything I can to make sure the machine is lean as can be. Here are a couple initial ideas:

<ul><li>Turn off wake-on-lan (wake for administrator access)</li><li>Remove second graphics card (only using two displays now anyway)</li><li>Remove the modem</li><li>Reduce processor performance</li><li>Enable every energy saving option there is!</li></ul>

The dual-G5 does use a lot of energy: about <strong>144 watts</strong> at idle, with no display. Add a display or two and you're up over 200. That's with one graphics card, (4) 512MB ram chips, 1 sata drive, and a mouse and keyboard. Also, I set the processor to "reduced" performance. The "spin down hard disks when possible" option didn't seem to do much. Putting the computer to sleep reduced its power consumption to about 5 watts. <b>Dual G4 Powermac</b>

I was glad to find that the Dual-G4 fares better - though its obviously slower. Mine runs at about 80 watts without a display or any usb peripherals. With some tweaking, I might be able to get that lower. <b>Titanium Powerbook - a.k.a. Tibook</b>

The Tibook has great efficiency. Mine runs at about 18 watts idle with the display dimmed, but still visible. I was surprised it was so low. What's nice is that you can also <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.mac.portables/browse_thread/thread/8d349929c86ff596/f75c0506ac817b5e%23f75c0506ac817b5e">run the TiBook with the lid closed</a>, using an external display and peripherals. <b>Mac Mini Power</b>

I just bought a iMac 17" for my office - and I'm very glad I did. Its a fast machine and as you can see from the links above, very energy efficient. I'm surprised though that the Mac Pro's aren't more energy efficient. <b>Mac Pro Power Consumption</b>

Like making your car more fuel efficient by not driving it - I think the best way to make the dual-G5 more efficient is by not using it. :-(
