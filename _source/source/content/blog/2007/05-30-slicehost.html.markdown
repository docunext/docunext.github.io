So I just cancelled my last outsourced hosting provider, and in my opinion, the best one. It was slicehost.com, and they provide virtual private servers at a premium, but their level of service makes all the difference. Why'd I cancel then?

I recently obtained a second Comcast Business account for another location, and when I did so, I requested 13 IP addresses. I'm going to use those instead.

UPDATE: Slicehost was very graceful with our cancellation, even refunded our last automatic payment which was processed a few days prior to their notice about the IP transition. If they hadn't I would have put up a stink, so they saved us both some trouble. The moral of this story? If I opt for virtual private hosting again, I'll choose Slicehost.
