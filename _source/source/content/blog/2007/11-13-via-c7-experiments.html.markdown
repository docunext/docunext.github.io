Now that the <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/11/via-c7-pc2500e.html">Via C7 is again available at a reasonable price</a>, I'm planning some more experiments for this cool chip.

First thing I want to do is again build an OCF linux kernel with support for accelerated VPNs. I'm going to use Debian as the base, building it as minimal as possible using the <a href="http://www.nodows.com/">nodows</a> builder scripts based on <a href="http://phing.info/trac/" rel="nofollow">phing</a> (or Rake).

I'm also hoping that the openssl and openssh patches for use with padlock and ocf-linux have matured a little since the last time I tried something along these lines. I'd also like to experiment with Apache and SSL.
