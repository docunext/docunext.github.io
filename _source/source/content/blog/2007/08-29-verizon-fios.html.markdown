I'm dying to get Verizon FIOS. While I don't trust several factors outside of the data center to mission critical hosting, I do like having fast upstream and low prices.

Hopefully we'll be able to get <a href="http://www.cabotplace.net/category/fios/">FIOS into our business multiple dwelling unit</a> very soon!
