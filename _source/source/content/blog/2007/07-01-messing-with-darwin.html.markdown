So I'm doing some tinkering with Darwin again as I'm trying to get <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/30/converting-parallels-machines-to-vmware-fusion/">kqemu to work on Mac OS X</a>. I don't think it will work but since I'm motivated I'm using this as an excuse to learn. :-)I've just downloaded the kernel sources, the extra kernel tools, and XCode 2.4 from Apple's sources. Actually I'm still downloading the XCode sources, big stuff (940MB)! While I have a little experience with kernel modules from my times with Gentoo and debian, I'm new to them on OSX. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/HOWTO">Thankfully, Amit Singh and the MacFUSE project have provided a little bit of details for kernel extensions on OSX</a>.

Actually, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mike.kronenberg.org/mike/?p=11">Kberg does have a small post about darwin kqemu with some notes and a download</a>.

And the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/chapter_17_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH220-DontLinkElementID_223">Kernel  Extension Overview</a> from Apple.com. Over my head.
