After a lame effort on my part to switch to using <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/12/safari-versus-camino.html">Safari instead of Camino</a>, I'm back with Camino, and I'm loving it. Everything about Camino seems smoother. It does annoy me that I can't use multiple user names and passwords with a single domain name, but its not that big of a deal. I should really keep my user names and passwords better organized anyway.
