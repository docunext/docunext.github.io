I just got an email from NetFirms letting me know my account was up for renewal. I responded saying that I <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/04/canceling-netfirms-account.html">canceled my Netfirms account back in April of this year</a>, over six months ago.

Then I just received another email from them alleging that my account was not properly closed, and that they only process account cancellations over the phone. I responded quickly, as well as forwarded them the email I sent in April of 2007.

Looks like other people have had similar and worse issues:

UPDATE December 12, 2007: With a little bit of polite persistence, I was able to cancel my NetFirms account without having to call them. They requested I either send my account information (maybe they should add some options on their control panel to cancel?) or email them the welcome email they sent me when I opened the account. Luckily I still had it, so I emailed that to them.
