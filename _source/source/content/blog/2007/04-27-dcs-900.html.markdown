Couple of issues: * Time zone* Password* Focus

Set to upload 2,419,200 files in an auto sequence. 1 image / second, stored for one month. At 50k per file (640x480) that will take up 120,960,000k, 120,960MB, 120.96GB. Not bad for four weeks of surveillance. Grrr, except that the DCS-900 sequence only goes up to 65000, which is less than a single days worth of still images. I slowed the frequency down to one image every 6 seconds.
