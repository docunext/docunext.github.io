Move over Zonbu, there's another green PC manufacturer in town: Koolu. Instead of the VIA C7, they chose the AMD Geode, which is a great processor as well. Supposedly only uses 5 Watts of power. Nice!

They are selling the device for $199 with 256MB of RAM with no storage. This unit is designed for use as a real thin client to connect to a LTSP server.
