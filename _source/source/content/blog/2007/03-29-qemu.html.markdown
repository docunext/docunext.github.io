Sweet! Just got QEMU installed on Ubuntu!

Thanks to:

<a href="http://codepoets.co.uk/docs/qemu_windows2000_on_ubuntu_linux_howto">Katherine and David Goodwin - How to install QEmu on Ubuntu Linux (Breezy)</a>

I had a bit of a problem with the graphics, but I installed libsdl-dev and then compiled the latest version of qemu manually and it worked fine.

<pre>apt-get install libsdl-dev</pre>
