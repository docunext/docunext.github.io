      Why not just use Akismet? It's free for non-commercial use. I have 100% success with it blocking SPAM, no false positives to speak of, and integrates right into Wordpress.

      Hi Erik - I was just reading your blog today on how to install DJabberd - thanks for the howto!<br/><br/>I don't think my blogs are non-commercial because I have adsense integrated into them. Anyway, Spam Karma 2 is working out great ever since I staggered the comment IDs:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2007/06/spam-karma-2-database-problem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2007/06/20/spam-karma-2-database-problem/</a>

I'm trying out a new comment spam defense: Spam Karma 2. This is in addition to Bad Behavior, and I probably don't need both, but Bad Behavior wasn't doing enough. Since last night when I activated the Wordpress plugin, I've received no spam.

I also tried Hash-cash, but was unable to post a comment at all.
