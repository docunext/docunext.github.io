dot5hosting accepted my order without my explicit request. To be more specific, their website is setup such that if you press return with a cursor in the form, your order is processed. So I requested they cancel my order, which they eventually did, only upon my dispute request through American Express.

Needless to say, my experience with dot5hosting was shortlived, so I can't say anything about a relationship with them. Based upon their customer service from the outset, I won't bother finding out.
