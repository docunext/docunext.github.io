I don't use Network Solutions hosting services personally, but one of my customers uses them for their email and web hosting. I use them to register many domain names though.

In my limited experience with their hosting, I have found their performance to be lacking, especially when it comes to speed.

<b><font style="font-size: 1.25em;">Network Stability and Uptime</font>
</b>The network is stable, though definitely oversold, causing sites to load slowly from time to time. I have experienced a DNS outage with Network Solutions before though, that lasted several hours and prevented any access to my clients' sites.

Control Panel Usability</b></font>

The control panel is packed with features like webftp, user management and more, but its difficult to navigate and access these functions.
