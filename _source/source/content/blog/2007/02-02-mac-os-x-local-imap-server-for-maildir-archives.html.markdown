title: mac os x local imap server for maildir archives
date: 2007-02-02

Rather than keep creeping the size of the last post, here's the deal: I'm installing an IMAP server locally on my Macs so that I can:

<ul><li>Access the email from Mail.app without having to be "offline" or syncronize of the network.</li><li>Syncronize my home without having a ton of email in two different forms: emlx and maildir.</li><li>Access my mail from the linux command line using Mutt.</li></ul>

The old drawback I see to this (so far) is the inability to access my archived maildirs from my webmail client.
