So I keep swaying back and forth between whether I prefer ubuntu or debian. Every once in awhile I'll say to myself - "Ubuntu is better" or "Debian is better".

At the moment, I'm leaning towards debian for non-gui setups, and ubuntu for desktop / laptop setups. I was really into xubuntu for awhile, but I'm now leaning towards vanilla ubuntu.
