I'm trying to install a more recent version of GnuCash on an Ubuntu machine using these instructions:

<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=222221">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=222221</a>

Actually I noticed it was building an old version of GnuCash so I'm trying the packages mentioned <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2006/09/14/gnucash-20-on-ubuntu-dapper/">here</a>.

I'll post copies of those files here because the place you download them from is obnoxious! <del>gnucash_201-1_i386deb.gz</del><del>gnucash-common_201-1_alldeb.gz</del>

Once you've got 'em downloaded, follow the <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2006/09/14/gnucash-20-on-ubuntu-dapper/">GNUCash 2.0 on Ubuntu Dapper instructions at Holy Shmoly</a>.

<strong>Note</strong>: I have no idea where these files came from, and I strongly recommend you consider this when using these files. It may not be such a good idea to use software of unknown origins for any reason, and if you do, it might be a good idea to only use it for evaluation purposes. These downloads come with the usual NO WARRANTY!

UPDATE: Even better, download them from a debian mirror, like this one: <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gnucash/gnucash_2.0.5-1_i386.deb">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gnucash/gnucash_2.0.5-1_i386.deb</a> (though there are ubuntu / debian issues with that one, don't use it)

<h3>EVEN BETTER WAY TO USE GNUCASH ON UBUNTU</h3>

Sorry for the caps, just want to make sure you don't waste your time on the stuff above. Just use Edgy Eft if you can. Packages for GnuCash 2+ are available there. :-) I finished the update from dapper to edgy today and the install of gnucash went fine.

P.S. - I just found this <a href="http://cashutil.sourceforge.net/">CashUtil - a command line interface to GnuCash</a>. Very cool!

UPDATE November 2007: I removed the above mentioned files, use the native Ubuntu packages instead.
