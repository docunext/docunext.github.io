title: Canceling NetFirms Account
date: 2007-04-10

Since I was able to successfully <a href="http://www.docunext.com/resources/blog/?p=6">transfer my domains from Netfirms to DynDns.com</a>, I've written to NetFirms to cancel my account and not renew any services:

<blockquote>Hello,

I am not satisfied with the performance of your hosting service, and have transferred my domains away to another registrar. Please cancel my account "toobinator.com" and do not renew any services for it.

Regards, </blockquote>
