I recently learned that Canonical's launchpad system is not open source - and in light of Mark Shuttleworth's recent urges that the open source community unite its bug reporting processes, I wonder what the real objective is here.

There are a few things I like about Ubuntu:

<ul><li>That is has the DSDT override patch in the kernel</li><li>It has great laptop support</li></ul>

And I like that Canonical is putting pressure on manufacturers to open up their hardware drivers, but I'm starting to get more wary of them. I'm so amazed with Debian, I can't help but be disappointed with Ubuntu from time to time.
