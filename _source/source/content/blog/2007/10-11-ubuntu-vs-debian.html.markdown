Argh. Yet another conflict between debian and ubuntu, this time having to do with "device-mapper device lookup failed". Too bad, I believe it has something to do with ubuntu startup process, but it totally kludged up my machine. Now to compile another kernel....

I wish ubuntu would be more debian friendly.

Hmm, I think this might have been my fault actually -- using some gutsy sources, some feisty, and that caused the problem. Not sure though, I ended up having to start fresh.
