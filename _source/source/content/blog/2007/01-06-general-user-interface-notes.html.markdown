<strong>Layout</strong>

Navigation across the top and down to the left. The center holds the product, the right side holds the

description. The bottom holds the general information.

<strong>Functionality </strong>

Make it easy to tell other people about it. Friendster grew so quickly because part of it was all about linking

in new people. An automatic emailer system.
