Network Solutions used to be just expensive, now they are getting annoying. Every time I login, there is more crap on the screen, making it harder than ever to simply accomplish the task that I logged in for. I can expect this type of interface from budget companies, but when paying a premium, I don't want to be haggled for more business.
