I just found an awesome plugin for bbPress - <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/44#post-173">registration restriction</a>!

This is really great because I keep getting oodles of FAKE registrations that never do anything with their account. The names are ridiculous too, I won't bother repeating them here, but use your imagination.
