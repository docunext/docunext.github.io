I signed up for 1and1 in early 2007 and have found their control panel to be lacking, but their network to be speedy and reliable. I've continued to hosted with them for several a few on their beginner package, and while I found their control panel software difficult to use, their network has been rock solid reliable.

Note: they recently increased the price of their beginner package. It is still quite affordable though.
