      The only issue I can think of that this would cause would be the VOIP service, but I think that since the public server doesn't use all the bandwidth, it should be OK. I also prioritized traffic to the SIP IP, so it should be fine.

Note to self: today you updated the traffic shaping rules on the m0n0wall net4501 to prioritize the in-office public server, and penalize the office local area network. Keep an eye on this rule to see if there are any negative results.
