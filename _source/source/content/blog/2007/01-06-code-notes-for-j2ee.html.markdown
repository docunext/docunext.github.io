This looks to be a great book. I look forward to learning about J2EE. This looks like a great book, so far I am

interested in JDBC and Java Mail libraries. The JDBC stuff is a little confusing to me, it might make sense to

skip this chapter and move on to servlets and JSP. The question I have about JDBC is simply how to connect

to a MySQL database.
