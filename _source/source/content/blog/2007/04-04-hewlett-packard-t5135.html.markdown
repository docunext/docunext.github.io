Three Hewlett Packard t5135 machines showed up today. I couldn't get the bios up, but it booted off usb anyway. I started off the debian usb stick I have just to test, but then booted off a USB AstLinux stick. This is a nice machine for AstLinux, maybe even better than the WRAP or Soekris setups.

With this arrival, I'm going to switch one of my WRAP devices back to m0n0wall for installation at our colocation facility.
