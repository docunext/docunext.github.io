This weekend was nuts. One of my servers crashed, so when I rebooted it, I decided to upgrade the kernel, finally setup VLANs on the Cisco switch at the colo, and reconfigure the VPN there as well.

That was a perfect combination of stuff to happen at once for me to learn a whole bunch about networking and infrastructure.

The colo is now setup well enough that I can start the process of setting it up better. I'm planning to use <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/OpenVZ">OpenVZ</a>, load balancing, high-availability, and firewalls to their fullest potential, so that our infrastructure is more modular across the board.

Eventually, I'd like to setup pfSense high-availability routers at the front, but that is a ways away. :-)
