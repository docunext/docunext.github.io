The other day I learned about jumper bocks.  Its a little plastic piece on a hard drive that limits the data transfer rate to 1.5 gbits per second.  Remove that piece and you'll have your machine running at 3.0 gbits per second, however, the block is their because not all machines can function at 3.0 gbits per second.  Just a little tidbit I picked up the other day. :)
