I thought it would be much hard to mount an NFS share onto a Mac OS X client, but I did run into some issues I'll share here.

I tried: <pre>sudo mount_nfs your_nfs_server_address:/your/nfs/export your_target_directory</pre>

but got this error:

<pre>mount_nfs: /path/to/your/target_mount: Operation not permitted</pre>

To fix, use the -P flag, like so:

<pre>sudo mount_nfs -P your_nfs_server_address:/your/nfs/export your_target_directory</pre>
