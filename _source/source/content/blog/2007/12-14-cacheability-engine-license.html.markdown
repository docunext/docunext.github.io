I just wrote to Mark Nottingham, the author of the Cacheability Engine, to ask if he would reconsider licensing the software under the GPL or Affero GPL:

<blockquote>
I'm writing to inquire about the Cacheability Engine. I noticed you restrict the software from modification, however I had to patch it to make it work with more current versions of python. Would you please reconsider releasing this software under the GPL or Affero GPL?
</blockquote>

Hopefully he'll go for it. :-) If not, that would be a downer, because it's a great piece of software which could help improve website performance.

Oh well, his mail server (pobox.com) just rejected my email, even though I have a reverse IP A record on a static IP, an SPF record permitting the IP to send mail at my domain, and am not block listed anywhere. Too bad.

This is how the software is licensed:

<blockquote>
This software may be freely distributed, but may not be modified in any way.
</blockquote>

Lame? Yes.
