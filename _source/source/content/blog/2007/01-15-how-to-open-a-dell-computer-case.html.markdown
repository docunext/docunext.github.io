      "You open the case by laying it on its side, pressing two buttons, and folding it open like a book.We found it awkward to simultaneously press two large release buttons and lift the case open, and we encountered some uncomfortable resistance in swinging it all the way open."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4795797_open-dell-computer-case.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4795797_open-dell-computer-case.html</a>  gives a good step by step instructions.<br/><br/>   1.<br/>          * 1<br/><br/>            Unplug all cables, including the power cable, from the back of the computer. Move the computer to a clean workspace over an uncarpeted floor.<br/>          * 2<br/><br/>            Examine both sides of your Dell computer case carefully. One side has small, protruding feet. Lay the computer down on your workspace on this side.<br/>          * 3<br/><br/>            Move to the back of the computer where the connectors are. Look for two recessed buttons on the top and the bottom of the computer. Press these buttons gently with your fingers.<br/>          * 4<br/><br/>            Begin to pull the top part of the case upward as you grasp the buttons. The Dell case will swing open on a hinge on the front of the computer. As you begin to lift the case upward, release the buttons. If you continue to depress the buttons as you pull upward, the case will not open.<br/>          * 5<br/><br/>            Continue to move the top side of the computer case upward so that it opens like a book. Once the case is fully open, it should remain open on its own.<br/>          * 6<br/><br/>            Touch an unpainted part of the interior computer chassis to ground yourself. This will prevent you from shorting out the circuits inside with the static electricity which naturally circulates on your body. Leave the computer case open for as long as you need to work inside. This will reduce the need to open the case multiple times.<br/><br/>Read more: How to Open a Dell Computer Case | eHow.com <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4795797_open-dell-computer-case.html#ixzz1KJdQJ9wg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4795797_open-dell-computer-case.html#ixzz1KJdQJ9wg</a><br/><br/>"You open the case by laying it on its side, pressing two buttons, and folding it open like a book.We found it awkward to simultaneously press two large release buttons and lift the case open, and we encountered some uncomfortable resistance in swinging it all the way open."

To open one of the common dark and light gray Dell computer cases, there are two buttons that need to be pushed. There is one on the top, and one on the bottom. It makes sense to lay the machine on its side, then press the buttons together and gently pull the sides apart.

If you force it, you can break the plastic, which happened in this picture of a Dell computer case (hence the duct tape):
