I have some complaints about O'Reilly's Safari Service:

<ul><li>Too much irrelevant promotion - they keep blasting me with ads for videos which I don't want!</li><li>Not enough content! Seems like I've read all the good stuff in the first two months...</li></ul>

I just checked and they allow me to hide videos from search results. Hopefully that works.
