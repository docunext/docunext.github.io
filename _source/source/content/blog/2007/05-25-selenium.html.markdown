I'm going to start getting into software testing, and word on the street is that Selenium is a pretty decent program for doing this.  "Selenium is a test tool for web applications. Selenium tests run directly in a browser, just as real users do. And they run in Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. No other test tool covers such a wide array of platforms."  I hope selenium is fairly user friendly.
