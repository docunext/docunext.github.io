I purchased a copy of "Practical Ruby for System Administrators" by Andr√© Ben Hamou today at Barnes &amp; Noble. Its really good! Its my first book on Ruby and it is easy to read, and the author has a good sense of humor and an imaginative creative talent.

Speaking of creative talent, my wife and I just watched <a href="http://www.neofilmz.com/blog/2007/06/howls-moving-castle.html">Howl's Moving Castle</a>. A great animation with all sorts of cool artwork and story lines.

But back to ruby, I like it as a programming language so far. It is straightforward and easy to implement. It might be an good language to learn before trying to tackle C or C++. One thing that interested me already is the standard libraries it has access to, like the ssh socket.
