      Finally got it to work. I had to do it via live.com, no msn.com. Furthermore, it wouldn't work in Camino, I did it via Q (QEMU) and Windows XP, but then found it works in regular Firefox too, even Deer Park! Cool. Now hopefully this site will have better exposure in Microsoft's search engine SERPS.

No matter what I do, I cannot for the life of me to get My MSN to index any of my Wordpress blog feeds, or any blog feeds for that matter. Argh, what am I doing wrong??
