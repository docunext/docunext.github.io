I'm now going to use my dectop computer as a webcam. It's pretty easy, just installed debian, then downloaded the gspca driver, downloaded the linux-source, the make! Only thing that was a little tricky was I had to change the kernel directory to /lib/modules/build in the gspcav Makefile.

I'm using the <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/09/22/logitech-quickcam-chat-for-14-at-ecostcom/">cheap and linux compatible refurbished logitech quickcams from ecost.com, as described at My Tech Deals</a>.
