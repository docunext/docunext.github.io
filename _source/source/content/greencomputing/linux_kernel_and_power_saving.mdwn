There are several *must-haves* when it comes to kernel features when trying to save power, such as:

* [[ACPI]]
* [[APM]]
* [[CPU Frequency Scaling]]

There are a lot less obvious ones too, including sound codec power saving, and IRQ interrupts. Wouldn't it be nice to have a pre-compiled kernel optimized for power saving in various linux distros, like Debian or RedHat?

## Software 

* [[Powertop]]
