This isn't too hard, but there are a few gotchas: 

* I installed using an external monitor, the notebook display won't work. To do so, use the BIOS to turn on LCD. 
* After installation, I booted into single user mode and remove GDM. 
* I updated everything, then installed openchrome (see link below)
* I use a custom DSDT

## Wireless 

To turn on wireless, use fn-F2. The radio is an Atheros based card, which is pretty good. 

## Video Driver 

I use the openchrome driver and it is also pretty good. 

## Touchpad 

I had some problems with the cursor, but eventually figured it on on the ubuntu machine. I'm trying to install debian on another one and the cursor remains invisible.
