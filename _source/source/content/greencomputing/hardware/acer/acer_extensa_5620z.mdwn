First and foremost, this laptop installs and runs Debian Lenny out of the box! They score major points for that. I haven't had a chance to test everything out, but I'm typing this from linux, so that's a start. I've heard rumors that wireless might be a challenge.

##Processor
The machine runs with an [[../../intel]] core duo processor, so its efficient from the get-go. I'm currently using 23 watts as I type this, measured via the [[../../Kill-A-Watt]]. Screen is on full brightness, and I haven't done any tuning to the system yet. Also - the battery is charging!
