### Debian on the Mac Mini

I used Lenny on the Mac Mini, because I wanted to use the xserver-xorg-video-intel driver. I'm getting between 19-22 Watts.

I've also used Squeeze on a Mac mini, and the installation process was made much easier by the introduction of BIOS compatibility withing Apple's firmware.

### nVidia Graphics Card

The nvidia-settings application that is available on Debian allows GPU power control.
