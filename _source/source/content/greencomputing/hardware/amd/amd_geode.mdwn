### Summary 

The AMD Geode has a few different variants, but my favorite is the LX800. It comes with a hardware random number generator, as well as a security block which provides hardware based cryptography acceleration, but only for the aes cipher at 128 bits. You can read about my efforts (successful!) to get the [AMD Geode aes security block activated using the linux CryptoAPI at the Docunext wiki](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/My_Notes_on_Patching_2.6.22_with_OCF).

### Power Consumption 

The results are amazing for a complete system that uses around 5 watts of power.
