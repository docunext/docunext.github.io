I'm writing this from an NC1503, which is very similar to the [[Everex Stepnote NC1501]] and [[Everex Stepnote NC1500]], however, all three do have some subtle differences, including hard drive and battery sizes. 

They also have different DSDT files, but I haven't had any problems applying the fan fix on any model. I was also able to install the openchrome driver on the NC1503, but the cursor was invisible on it. The openchrome docs included the fix - add:

<pre>
Option "SWCursor" "true"
</pre>

to the device section of the xorg.conf file.
