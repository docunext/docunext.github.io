I am currently working on an Everex laptop with [[VAI C7-M]], win xp home, 512mb ram, an external mouse.  Although Everex isn't really a household name, their machine still gives you a pretty good bang for your buck.  I use the machine mostly for work related projects and have not had any problems with the laptop thus far.  I respect this machine.
