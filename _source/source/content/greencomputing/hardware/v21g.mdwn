The V21G has a Via C7 in it, and with the right power supply can consume as little as 21Watts. That's pretty darn good for a C7 chip and a motherboard with 2 pci slots. 

This board used to sell at eWiz.com for only $55, and I bought two, but they don't have them anymore. Wish I bought more! They do have a similar version with a C3 in it.
