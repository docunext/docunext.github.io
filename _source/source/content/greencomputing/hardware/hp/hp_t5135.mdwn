I have been unable to get cpufreq to work with this processor yet. It does have "est" present in the processor flags, so it should be able to support the enhanced speedstep, or enhanced powersave functionality. The 2.6.21 kernel has support for that module, but I plan to hold off until the debian kernel becomes more stable.

The t5135 has the C3 power state! Looks as though it uses about 10-15 watts of energy with a USB drive. NICE!
