## Wake On Lan / Wake On PME / Wake on Ring 

On way is to turn on a computer remotely is through a network. This can be accomplished many ways but is commonly referred to as wake on lan, wake on pme, or wake on ring. This is actually a fairly complex process due to the number of variables involved, including, but not limited to, the following:

* physical network: the nics, wires, switches, hubs, and any physical items which comprise the network
* target computer to be turned on
* operating system the target computer is running, maybe a high quality system like linux, freebsd, or mac os x, or even other insecure and low quality operating systems (my biased opinion based upon years of computing experience)
* the driver used to operate the network card from the operating system
* the bios of the target computer
* the motherboard of the target computer

Complicated? Yes. Doable? Yes. 

* First things first, check your bios. That should have something about wake on lan or wake on pme. See [little valley d201gly bios pictures for an example](http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/07/d201gly-little-valley-bios.html)
* Operating System Specific Instructions
* Linux - [Use ethtool from the command line to activate wol](http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ethtool8.html)
* FreeBSD - more complicated, check <http://stsp.name/wol/> for support
* Mac OS X - should be easy, figure it out. :-)
* Controlling computer - tools to "push the button" are available everywhere, for all operating systems. Seek and ye shall find!

if [ "`cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep 'ILAN' | awk '{ print $3; }'`" == "enabled" ]
        then
        exit
        else
        echo ILAN > /proc/acpi/wakeup
