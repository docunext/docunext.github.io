## Laptops / Notebooks

Notebook computers are very efficient in the way they manage power. They have to! Sometimes they have to run off of a battery with a limited temporary lifespan. To do so, notebook computers reduce the brightness of the screen, spin down the hard drive (not a good idea to do very often though), reduce processor power, and even turn off the cooling fans. They also go to sleep to save power. The downside? They are more expensive. There are some notable exceptions though, check out the [http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/notebooks/ Notebooks Category at My-Tech-Deals.com].

##Servers

Servers are unfortunately serious power hogs. They run 24/7, often run at full power, and even have redundant power supplies. They generate a lot of heat too, and require special cooling. Still, they are great computers and in my opinion well worth the power usage.
