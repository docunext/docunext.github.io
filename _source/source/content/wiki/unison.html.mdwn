Unison is a file repository synchronization tool. It uses [[rsync]] to make efficient changes when synchronizing.

I first used unison on a [[Apple]] [[Macintosh]], and unfortunately I got a bad impression because at the time they were still using (perhaps still are) resource forks, and somehow a repository I was working on got messed up. These days I stick with what works: [[ext3]]!
