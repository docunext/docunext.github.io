### Dynamic DNS Summary
Dynamic [[DNS]] is a configuration whereby records are updated by hosts which are dynamically allocated [[IP]] addresses. The host sends an outgoing connection to a DNS server which is most likely set at a fixed address and informs the server of its current address. The server then updates its database to reflect the new address information.

### My Experience with Dynamic DNS
I've used dyndns.org, but I've always wanted to setup something like this on my own. Thanks to [[tinydyndns]], I can!
