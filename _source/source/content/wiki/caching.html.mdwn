### Summary
[[HTTP]] has a great mechanism for improving performance. Caching works very well, but it can cause problems when content is updated.

With [[Apache]], I use mod_mem_cache, and will probably use mod_disk_cache if I get some [[proxy]] systems for static data setup.

### Caching Strategies
The first thing I try to do when I'm evaluating caching strategies is understand the environment and goals, including content, visitors, and objectives.

Most of my web visitors are "one hit wonders", they visit, but never come back. Most of my content stays the same, but the html/text type content changes fairly often.

My main goal is to improve the user experience, and my secondary goals are to save bandwidth, and then to reduce processor load,

### Caching Factors
* Freshness
* Validation

### HTTP Headers
My favorite Cache-Control headers are "no-store" and "max-age".
