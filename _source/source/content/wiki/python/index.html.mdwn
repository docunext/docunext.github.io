Python is somewhat new to me, but now that I'm using trac to manage several
projects, I'm learning about it quickly. As of 2011, I've switched from Trac to
[[/Redmine]], a [[/Ruby]] project management tool. I personally found python to be 
too strict.

As of 2013, I had initially renewed my interest in python, but at the last minute decided
to try [[/Golang]] instead.

Here's a page for more [[/python/Python Examples]] and my [[/python/Python Notes]].
