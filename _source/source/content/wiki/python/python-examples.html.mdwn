'''Hello World'''
<pre>
print "Hello World!"
</pre>
Nice!

'''Tuple Iteration'''

A tuple is similar to a list or array:
<pre>
import sys
t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

count=0

for num in t:
    print num

print "hello world"
</pre>
I don't need import sys or print hello world, they are only there as leftovers.
