This is a method to replicate LDAP directories.

'''N.B.''' - In replication schemes I use the terms "primary" and "replicant".

### Primary Setup
Error:
<pre>
overlay "syncprov" not found
</pre>

I added these lines:
<pre>
moduleload      syncprov
</pre>
then later on...
<pre>
overlay syncprov
syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
syncprov-sessionlog 100
</pre>

### Replicant
Error:
<pre>
Error: Malformed "syncrepl" line in slapd config file, missing provider searchbase
</pre>
This was resolved by providing correct values for binddn.

I got the replicant to sync to the primary, but admin login fails after syncrepl. What gives? Not sure what the deal is - maybe when replication is setup, superuser access is disabled? I added the rootpw configuration option in the /etc/ldap/slapd.conf file to at least allow me to login, and that worked. Once I logged in, I noticed I could not change the admin's password.

#### syncrepl options
Type:
<pre>
type=refreshOnly|refreshAndPersist
</pre>
I'm trying out refreshAndPersist now.

Interval:
<pre>
interval=00:00:01:00
</pre>
For testing purposes I'd like the system to refresh every minute.
