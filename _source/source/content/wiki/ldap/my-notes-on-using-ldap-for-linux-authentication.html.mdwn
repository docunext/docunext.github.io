I'm using [[debian]], and so far I've gotten slapd running and logged in as admin using [[phpLDAPadmin]] and added a user. I can ldapsearch for that user, but cannot login.

I added ldap to my nsswitch.conf files, and can su as that user from root. I get this error when trying to login:
<pre>
 bdb_equality_candidates: (uid) not indexed
</pre>
I don't think that log message matters much.

In the end I su'd to the user, then ran passwd, then was able to login via ssh. Not sure what's up with that. When creating a new user - I need to use "cryptmd5".

### User Home Directories
There is a [[PAM]] module I use for automatically making home directories if they do not exist.
