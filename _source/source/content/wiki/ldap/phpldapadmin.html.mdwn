### My Complaints
I have my complaints about this software package, but I have to admit, I have used it extensively and it got the job done. I found phpldapadmin to be a bit bloated and overly complicated to use. When I started digging around the code to see if I could improve the performance at all, I found it to be really confusing to follow.

#### phpLDAPadmin Performance
Wow. I find that when using php5-cgi under [[libapache2-mod-fcgid]] to power phpLDAPadmin is really slow when used in combination with sessions. I switched to cookies and found it much faster.

### phpLDAPadmin Configuration
It took me awhile to figure out that "admin" is the admin username on [[debian]]'s slapd installation. Also, I had to change "dn" to "cn" in the login attr in

After I logged in, I tried the "Create new entry here" link, which provided me with these options:
{|
|
* Address Book Entry
* Address Book Entry (mozillaOrgPerson)
* Courier Mail Account
* Courier Mail Alias
* DNS Entry
* Organisational Role
* Organisational Unit
* Posix Group
|
* Posix Group - SUSE
* Samba3 Account
* Samba3 Group Mapping
* Samba3 Group Mapping - SUSE
* Samba3 Machine
* Simple Security Object
* User Account
* Default
|}

Finally, some stuff I understand! :-)
