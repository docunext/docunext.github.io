### Install
<pre>
apt-get install libnss-ldap
</pre>

### Configure
I was prompted for the ldap addresses, then the distinguished name, like dc=example,dc=net, then version, I chose 3, and then it asked for a user to have root access, but I left that empty because I only want to use it for host names.

### Customize
Add "ldap" to hosts: line in /etc/nsswitch.conf, then edit /etc/ldap.conf and supply info for uri, base, ldap_version, and nss_base_hosts.

Lenny uses /etc/libnss-ldap.conf

### Test
<pre class="sh_sh">
getent hosts
</pre>
