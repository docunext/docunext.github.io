Ubuntu uses a different process for managing LDAP authentication. Its a little frustrating because I just learned how to do it with [[debian]]!

Its really odd - I can see the LDAP users with getent passwd or getent shadow, but when I "su username" I get bunk. Same when I try to login via ssh.

It appears that [[Debian]] uses pam_unix.so while [[Ubuntu]] uses pam_ldap.so for [[LDAP]] authentication.

In an effect to do this the lazy way, I'm upgrade to [[Hardy Heron]]. :-) Maybe that will help me figure it out.

The upgrade was painful, but its done. I then continued with the ldap configuration, '''restarted''' and it works now. :-)

The key to getting it to work was learning about these two new packages:
* ldap-auth-config
* ldap-auth-client

As far as I can tell, they are meta-packages which combine all the required packages and configurations needed to get [[LDAP Authentication]] to work.
