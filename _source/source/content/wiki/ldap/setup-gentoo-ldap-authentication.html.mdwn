### Software Install
<pre>
emerge nss_ldap pam_ldap
</pre>
... proceed to get distracted by a "emerge -uDv world"...

I noticed this:
<pre>
 * QA Notice: Package has poor programming practices which may compile
 *            fine but exhibit random runtime failures.
 * pam_ldap.c:2358: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
</pre>

### Configuration
/etc/nsswitch.conf:
<pre>
passwd:      compat ldap
shadow:      compat ldap
group:       compat ldap
</pre>

There is no /etc/pam_ldap.conf like in [[debian]], and the /etc/pam.d/* files are much different. I'm not sure how to proceed, so I'm putting this on hold momentarily.
