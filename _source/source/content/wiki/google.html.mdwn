Google is a search engine, but they also have a lot of cool free and fee-based services and products.

### My Impressions of Google
I've been a fan of Google for many many years, and over the years, I've come to really admire some aspects of the company. However, there have been times when I've been sorely disappointed with their decisions, and even by some of their employees. Well, actually... only Chris DiBona and how publicly rude he was to [[Google Code]] users when they asked for clarification as to why the [[Affero GPL]] was not accepted as an [[open source]] license.

I am also disappointed that Google shut down [[Google Wave]].
