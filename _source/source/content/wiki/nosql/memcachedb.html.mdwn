This is interesting - a network server which uses the [[memcached]] protocol but uses [[Berkeley DB]] as the backend for persistent storage.

I'm trying this server out right now and so far it has been very easy to setup! Note that on [[Debian]], the default port is 21201, not 11211.

### TODO
* Figure out how to backup and potentially browse these databases
* Figure out how to do replication

### Backing Up MemcacheDB Data

Not sure yet, I tried this today:

<pre class="sh_sh">
db4.7_hotbackup -h `pwd` -b /root/mcdb/
</pre>
