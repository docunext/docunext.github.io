### What is a switch?
If you are new to networking, you might think that hubs and switches are the same thing. The hardware can look similar, but on the inside they are technically very different. They look similar because they most likely have several ports where you can plug in ethernet cables.

If you are relatively new to networking, you might wonder what the difference is between a bridge and a switch. There is no difference, they are the same concept. As Christian Benvenuti puts it in "Understanding Linux Networking Internals", the term bridge is used in documentation, while the term switch is used to refer to a real-world piece of hardware.

A switch is most commonly used to build a local area network. To my knowledge, a freshly installed switch will start funneling traffic by broadcasting packets to all ports, then as the ports pass the packets around for which it is not the destination, the switch will begin to cache the MAC addresses and IP numbers that are connected to each port. In a short period of time, the switch will know where to send future packets based up its address cache. As I said - that is to my knowledge - I'm not 100% sure that's how it works! Actually I just read on page 302 of "Understanding Linux Network Internals" that "this proces is called ''passive learning''".
