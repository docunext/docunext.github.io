Racoon is used in [[IPSEC]] implementations. Along with [[ipsec-tools]], it can create a [[VPN]] connection.

### Configuration Notes
For me to setup a VPN connection between a Linode virtual server and a pfsense gateway, I installed racoon and iproute and their dependencies on the linode machine. Then I edited /etc/racoon/racoon.conf and /etc/racoon/psk.txt. I had to open up port 500 on the linode machine, as well as restart setkey and racoon. Lastly to ping the gateway subnet from the linode machine I had to setup a route like this:

<pre>
ip route add 192.168.8.0/24 via 192.168.134.22 dev eth1 src 192.168.134.22
</pre>

### Potential Errors
<pre>
ERROR: failed to get sainfo.
</pre>

<pre>
INFO: unsupported PF_KEY message REGISTER
