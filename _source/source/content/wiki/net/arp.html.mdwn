ARP stands for address resolution protocol.

"[[DNS]] for machines", meaning it matched ip addresses with MAC (machine addresses).

I was looking to create a static ARP entry in my cache so that I could ssh into a sleeping computer without having to send a wake on lan request. On Mac OS X (and I imagine FreeBSD) I was able to do so by doing this:

    arp -s 987.654.321.000 xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx pub

and on linux:

    ip neighbor add 987.654.321.000 lladdr xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx dev eth0 nud permanent

Those are non-existent addresses up there, and the "pub" makes this host a arp server of sorts. I believe there are dangers in setting up static arp entries, but unfortunately I don't know what they are. For my purposes at the moment it shouldn't be a big deal.

In the linux example, you'd change eth0 to the device you plan to have neighboring the target.
