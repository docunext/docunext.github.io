"Of course it runs NetBSD!"

I'm interested in setting up a NetBSD [[VPS]] server, so I'm trying out NetBSD on [[QEMU]] first. I've read it is a very efficient operating system.

<pre class="sh_sh">
kvm -cdrom amd64cd-5.0.1.iso -hda netbsd.qcow2
</pre>

I ran dhclient to get an IP from QEMU.

Some basic stuff:

### NetBSD [[Filesystems]]

* NetBSD uses FFS aka [[UFS]] as its default file system.
* NetBSD supports [[ext2]], but not [[ext3]].
* It also supports [[ZFS]].
* Ah - it also supports [[unionfs]], but not [[aufs]].
* The NetBSD server I just installed on an [[ALIX]] board has a procfs mounted at /proc
* NetBSD supports [[NFS]] as a client and a server for [[NFS]] versions 2 and 3

### NetBSD and [[RAID]]
NetBSD implements a software raid using [[RAIDframe]].

### NetBSD and [[Xen]]
I just read at Wikipedia that some operating systems run faster as a [[Xen]] virtual machine that is hosted by NetBSD than when installed directly on the same hardware. Incredible!!

I've been meaning to start working with [[Xen]], so perhaps I'll get a chance while I learn NetBSD. UPDATE: I've signed up for a NetBSD [[VPS]] with [http://www.informedhosting.com/blog/prgmrcom/ prgrm]. I can't wait to get this running. UPDATE 2: I got impatient and instead installed [http://www.docunext.com/blog/2009/09/installing-netbsd-on-alix-1d.html NetBSD on an ALIX 1D].
