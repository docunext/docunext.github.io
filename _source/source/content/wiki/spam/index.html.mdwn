### All About Spam
Ugh, can we ever have [[email]] without spam? Doubtful. Thankfully programs like
[[Postfix]] and [[Spamassassin]] make spam less of a problem.

Spam (unsolicited bulk [[email]]) is nasty stuff! There are some ways to defend
against it:

* [[Spamassassin]]
* [[DNSRBL]]
* [[Fail2Ban]]
* [[DSpam]]

### Spam Fighting Strategies

* [[Greylisting]]
* [[Nolisting]]

### Storing Pass and Block List Information
Since there are multiple applications which use pass and block list information,
I've been wanting to store that information in a central database for awhile. In
mid-2008, I started to use [[XSL]] to output plain text in various configuration
formats, which could then be used with configuration files for different
programs. As of June 2008, I haven't yet done this with [[Spamassassin]] or
[[Postfix]], but I'm going to plan out the data model and stylesheets required
to do so.
