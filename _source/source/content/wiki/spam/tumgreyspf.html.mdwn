Tumgreyspf is a [[/Python]] software package which can be used by [[/Postfix]] to
check [[/SPF]] records and filter incoming mail. I'm trying it out on my backup
MX servers because they can be used to relay mail to the primary mail
server. My primary email server only checks SPF records after accepting mail
during the [[/spam/Spamassassin]] scans.

### SPF Checks Only

    SPFSEEDONLY = 0
    GREYLISTTIME = 600
    CHECKERS = spf
    OTHERCONFIGS = client_address,envelope_sender,envelope_recipient

    # The number of days after which, if no messages have come in, we will
    # drop the greylist entry.
    GREYLISTEXPIREDAYS = 10.0

This setup has resulted in the /etc/cron.daily/tumgreyspf failing due to the
waitlist directories not being there:

~~~
/etc/cron.daily/tumgreyspf:
find: `/var/lib/tumgreyspf/data/*/*/*/check_file': No such file or directory
rmdir: failed to remove `/var/lib/tumgreyspf/data/*/*/*': No such file or directory
rmdir: failed to remove `/var/lib/tumgreyspf/data/*/*': No such file or directory
rmdir: failed to remove `/var/lib/tumgreyspf/data/*': No such file or directory
run-parts: /etc/cron.daily/tumgreyspf exited with return code 1
~~~

So I'm adding this to the top of /etc/cron.daily/tumgreyspf:

    # 20110116 ALL4 only used for SPF, no waitlisting data.
    exit 0
