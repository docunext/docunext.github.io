This is a sweet configuration! In this setup, [[Dovecot]] is performing the task of accessing emails for users as well as delivering emails to mailboxes for [[Postfix]].

### Initial Considerations
* Use [[LDAP]] or virtual patterns for finding home directories
* Use [[LDAP]], [[SQL]] or passwd file for authenticating users
* No SSL or Plaintext passwords for trusted [[IMAP]] proxies - see: [[Dovecot IMAP Proxy for a Mail Gateway]]
