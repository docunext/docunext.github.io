I'm probably going to switch from squid to apache for all my http caching purposes. Why? Because I really like Apache and want to learn as much about it as possible.

I did make the switch from Squid to Apache 2.2 for proxy caching purposes!

[[Apache 2.2 Proxy Caching Configuration]]

For disk caching, I'm using this command to clean the cache periodically:
<pre>
htcacheclean -v -n -t -l 20M -p /var/cache/apache2/mod_disk_cache/
</pre>

This nice little message is emailed out to me too:
<pre>
