Security certificates are part of a public key infrastructure ([[PKI]]).

I'd like to create certificates for the following protocols, which often use different IP addresses, and thus most likely different DNS records:

* [[LDAP]]
* [[SMTP]]
* [[IMAP]]
* [[HTTP]]
* [[FTP]]

Thankfully, some certificate authorities offer multiple sub-domains at a discount. Alternatively, a single server could be used to handle all [[TLS]] connections and simply route them to a specific backend, preferably over another encrypted connection, such as a [[VPN]].
