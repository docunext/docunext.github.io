SQLite is a novel approach to databases - it is simple a file format API,
not a program. It is therefore very lightweight and doesn't consume too many
processing or memory resources.

### Versions
There are 2 flavors of SQLite commonly available - version 2 and version 3.
Unfortunately they aren't compatible with each other as far as I know.

#### SQlite version 2
"sqlite"
I've had much more experience with version 2 because [[/PHP]] database
abstraction layers like MDB2 only support sqlite version 2 as of early 2008.

#### SQLite version 3
This is the version I try to use as much as possible now that we're in 2009.

Its commonly used with [[/Ruby/Ruby on Rails]], so I used it quite often in 
2011 and on.
