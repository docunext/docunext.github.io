Keychain is a sweet little program written by [[Daniel Robbins]] of [[Gentoo]] fame. It works with [[Ssh-agent]] to enable "sessions" with [[SSH]].

I've used it in the past to avoid having to also unlock my [[Gnome Keyring]] for [[nm-applet]].

### Setup
From the command line, simply entering keychain, followed by the path to the key to add, should do the trick. For example:

<pre class="sh_sh">
keychain .ssh/github
</pre>
