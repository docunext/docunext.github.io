### Summary
A load balancer is a system or service which distributes a load across two or more back-end services. Common examples include [[web server]] load balancers.

Many load balancers test the back ends periodically to make sure that they are functioning, and remove them from the pool of available back-ends if they are unavailable. Furthermore, there is also sometimes a setting for a fail over destination, when none of the regular back-ends are functional or accessible.
