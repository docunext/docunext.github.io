I'm trying to learn about bittorrent. There are a few things I was confused
about, like that there is no single server. A .torrent file lists a tracker, and
the tracker lists peers and seeders. Peers are people who are downloading files,
and hopefully uploading as well. Clients are also servers. Seeders are people
who have entire, complete copies of files for which the tracker is listed.

### HOWTO
To try out how bittorrent worked, I used mod_bt on [[debian]], with
torrentflux, bittorrent and ktorrent. I started the tracker (mod_bt), then
uploaded a file to torrentflux and its .torrent file. I'm still not exactly
sure how the first file gets going, but the tracker starts to keep track of how
many people have parts of the files. Then torrent peers actually do the data
transfers.

### Bittorrent Command Line Client
After installing bittorrent on [[debian]], there are several tools which can be
used. To download [[NetBSD]] via bittorrent, I downloaded the torrent file from
the [[NetBSD]] [[FTP]] site, and then ran:

    btdownloadcurses i386cd-5.0.1.iso

which produced:
