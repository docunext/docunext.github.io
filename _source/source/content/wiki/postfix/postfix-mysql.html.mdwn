In reading over my old [[Postfix]] notes, I'm wondering why I didn't just use postfix-mysql instead of postfix -> sasl -> mysql? Who knows... oh wait - postfix-mysql is for delivery information, not for authentication, right?

<pre class="sh_sh">
user = user
password = pass
dbname = dbnam
table           = auth_user
select_field    = maildir
where_field     = email
hosts = localhost
</pre>
