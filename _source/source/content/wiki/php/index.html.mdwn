PHP is loved and hated by many. Its been around for awhile and is often used as
a web site programming language. Its had its share of problems, successes, and
it continues to strive as more programming languages (like [[/Ruby]],
[[/Python]], and many more) enter the web site programming arena. I've used it
almost exclusively; it was recommended many years ago by a good friend whose
opinion on technical matters I respect and it has been a great tool for me.
