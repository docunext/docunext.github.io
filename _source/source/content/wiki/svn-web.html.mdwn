I wanted to setup a multi-repository [[subversion]] browser for my own use. I found SVN-Web to fit my needs, as it supports [[caching]] and simple templates. I'm always looking for an excuse to learn more about [[perl]] as well.

Its a bit of a pain to install on debian, but I managed to do so with the help of [[apt-get]] and [[CPAN]].

### Packages
<pre>
apt-get install libtemplate-perl libsvn-perl libsvn-web-perl libtimedata-perl
apt-get install libcache-cache-perl libfcgi-procmanager-perl libfcgi-perl libyaml-perl
apt-get install libexception-class-perl liblocale-maketext-lexicon-perl
apt-get install libcgi-fast-perl
</pre>

### CPAN
<pre>
install Template::Plugin::Number::Format
</pre>

### Errors
Many problems with newer versions of [[Subversion]]:
[http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/10/22/svn_ra_get_log-assertion-path-failed/ svn_ra_get_log: Assertion `*path != ‘/” failed.]
Fix? [[SVN::Web and Subversion 1.5]]
