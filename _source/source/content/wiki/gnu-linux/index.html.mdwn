### Summary
Linux is really awesome in my humble opinion. It is an [[operating system]] [[kernel]] which is usually paired with the [[GNU]] [[userland]] tools. It is licensed under the [[GPL]] version 2, which requires that kernel modules also be licensed as [[GPL]]. It was originally created by [[Linus Torvalds]] and while he still leads the project, it is contributed to by thousands of individuals and organizations. [[Intel]], [[IBM]], [[RedHat]] and even [[Microsoft]] have contributed to the linux kernel.
