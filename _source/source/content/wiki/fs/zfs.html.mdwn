ZFS is a file system created by [[Sun Microsystems]], which supports "zetabyte" sized volumes. It was recently released as open source, but since its not [[GPL]], it can't be included in the [[linux]] kernel as an official module. :-(

[[FreeBSD]] has experimental support for it though, and there is a [[FUSE]] module which provides ZFS support on linux.

### ZFS Command
There is actually a command "zfs".

### Storage Pools
ZFS uses storage pools, but as of yet, I don't know what these are. They are managed using the zpool command.
<pre>
root@nexenta-base:~# zpool list
NAME      SIZE   USED  AVAIL    CAP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
syspool  3.47G  1.21G  2.25G    35%  ONLINE  -
</pre>

### Example Procedures
<pre>
zfs create syspool/blah
zfs set mountpoint=/root/blah syspool/blah
umount /root/blah
zfs mount syspool/blah
</pre>
Pretty cool!
