FUSE stands for [[Filesystem]] in [[Userspace]]. Why is this notable? Because filesystems usually run in the [[Kernel]], and by running them in userland, the super user (root) requirement is removed. Unprivileged users can then easily mount and unmount filesystems at will.

Arguably at the cost of performance, it also contributes to system stability.

FUSE is only the bridge between the kernel and the filesystem implementation, making it much simpler for third-party developers to create additional filesystem types.
