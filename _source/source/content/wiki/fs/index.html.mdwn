The filesystem is the organization and storage mechanism for data stored locally on a computer. Filesystems on POSIX compliant operating systems usually have a "root" directory inside of which all other directories are stored.

[[File System Hierarchy Standard]]

### Incomplete List of Filesystems ==
* [[ext2]] - the same as [[ext3]], without journal support
* [[ext3]] - my favorite filesystem for use with the [[Linux]] kernel
* [[ext4]] - the future of [[ext3]] for use with super gigantic filesystems
* [[HFS]] - [[Mac OS X]]
* [[Btrfs]] - another new filesystem for [[Linux]], supposedly similar to [[ZFS]]
* [[NFS]] - [[Network]] filesystem
* [[squashfs]] - compressed
* [[ZFS]] - From [[Solaris]], now available in [[FreeBSD]]
* [[ReiserFS]] - supposed to be super fast for lots and lots of little files
* [[XFS]] - Alternative to [[ext3]] on [[Linux]]
* JFS - Alternative to [[ext3]] on [[Linux]]
* [[UFS]] - Default filesystem on [[FreeBSD]]
* [[Tux3]]
* [[NILFS]]

Filesystems are usually created on top of [[partitions]].

When I found myself with a lot of well organized files, I realized a need to [[backup]] and [[synchronize]] them.
