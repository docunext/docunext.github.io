### Summary
NRPE =  Nagios Remote Plugin Executor Plugin

### My Quick Start
I did this on the [[Debian]] [[Nagios]] node (not the [[Nagios]] server):
* Edited /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg and changed allowed_hosts to include the IP of my nagios server

On the server:
* Edited /etc/nagios3/conf.d/services_nagios2.cfg, added new services for check_nrpe. One of mine looks like this:
<pre>
define service {
        hostgroup_name                  nrpe-servers
        service_description             Check Users
        check_command                   check_nrpe_1arg!check_users
        use                             generic-service
        notification_interval           0 ; set > 0 if you want to be renotified
}
</pre>
