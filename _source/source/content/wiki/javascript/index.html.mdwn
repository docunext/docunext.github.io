### Javascript Summary
I hate to admit it, but I'm not too familiar with javascript, also known as [[ECMAScript]]. I'm starting to have more faith in it. Its lame-o issues like cross-browser incompatibilities that annoy the heck out of me.

I like to use javascript for [[GUI]] stuff mostly, not too much beyond that. [[AJAX]] is the use of javascript to make http requests and handle server responses, pretty cool if you ask me.

#### Javascript Example
<pre>
location.href='index.php'
</pre>

#### UPDATE
I've certainly become a lot more familiar with Javascript since I first wrote this article. I'd still say I'm more familiar with [[jQuery]], but I've also learned a lot more about software engineering in general. However, I still don't use enough straight up javascript on an everyday basis to have become an expert at it.
