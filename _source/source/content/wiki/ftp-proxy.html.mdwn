### FTP Proxy Summary
On debian, the configuration file is in /etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf.

I was hoping to do some relaying / routing of FTP requests based upon username, like [[Perdition]], but it doesn't look like that's possible.

Instead I'm using [[NFS]] to mount remote file stores on a central server which runs [[proftpd]].
