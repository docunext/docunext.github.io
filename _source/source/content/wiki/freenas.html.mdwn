FreeNAS is an open source network area storage operating system, based off of [[m0n0wall]]. It is build on [[FreeBSD]] and uses the [[lighttpd]] web server, among a variety of other open source software packages. An example configuration would be a computer setup with a network interface card, a compact flash drive to run the FreeNAS OS, and at least one hard drive to use as storage.

* I'd love to see something like [[DRBD8]] in FreeNAS. That would be awesome!
* Would be cool to see [[ZFS]] too. UPDATE: Looks like its been implemented, but I haven't tried it out.
* How about [[Git]]? That would be awesome.
