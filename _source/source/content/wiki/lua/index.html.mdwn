Lua is a small, fast, embeddable scripting language.

I'm pleased to discover it is used with OpenWRT to help power their web
interface, and there are also WSAPI / [[/FastCGI]] connectors and
a [[/Database]] abstraction layer for Lua.

After learning how to write Lua for a few weeks, I'm really starting to like it.
It reminds me a lot like bash, but with a lot more going for it. I don't see
myself using it for building applications just yet, but its great for
interfacing with applications.
