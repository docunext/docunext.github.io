### $XDG_CONFIG_HOME Summary
I'm becoming a big fan of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. I will explain it later, just compiling some resources for now.

I've come up with some workarounds for applications which don't support it yet, like:

#### [[Gimp]]
In /etc/profile:

    export GIMP2_DIRECTORY=~/.config/gimp-2.6

NO! That totally doesn't work!

I think the solution might be to use pam_env.so! See [[Pam Environment]].

    # MUST BE RELATIVE, NO TILDA
    GIMP2_DIRECTORY=.config/gimp-2.6



#### [[Keychain]]
In my .bashrc:

    /usr/bin/keychain --dir ~/.config/.keychain/ ~/.ssh/id_dsa
    source ~/.config/.keychain/*-sh > /dev/null

#### [[jEdit]]
In /usr/bin/jedit:

    exec $JAVA -Xmx${JAVA_HEAP_MAX_SIZE}M -jar /usr/share/jEdit/jedit.jar -reuseview -settings="$HOME/.config/jedit" "$@" &

#### [[Sitecopy]]

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/bin/sitecopy -r .config/sitecopyrc -p .config/sitecopy_storage "$@"
