### CentOS Summary
CentOS is, as I understand it, based on [[RedHat]]. That is true, the RedHat enterprise distribution. As they state on their website:
<blockquote>
CentOS is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by a prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor.  CentOS conforms fully with the upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.)  CentOS is free.
</blockquote>

CentOS stands for "Community Enterprise Operating System"!

### CentOS Project
In mid-2009, there was an open letter written by the project developers to the manager of the centos.org domain name. As of August, 2009, the issues stated in the letter appear to be resolved. I'm personally pleased to see the CentOS Project become more community focused and organized.

### My Experience with CentOS
Well, I finally got a CentOS server setup. I signed up for a "Village" [[VPS]] from vpsville.ca. Its a very minimal machine, I signed up just so I could learn about CentOS. I will host some non-mission critical services there eventually, once I'm comfortable with CentOS.

#### Package Management: [[yum]]
<pre>
Loading "installonlyn" plugin
You need to give some command
usage: yum [options] < grouplist, localinstall, groupinfo, localupdate, resolvedep, erase, deplist, groupremove, makecache, upgrade, provides, shell, install, whatprovides, groupinstall, update, groupupdate, info, search, check-update, list, remove, clean, grouperase >

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t, --tolerant        be tolerant of errors
  -C                    run entirely from cache, don't update cache
  -c  [config file]     config file location
  -R  [minutes]         maximum command wait time
  -d  [debug level]     debugging output level
  -e  [error level]     error output level
  -y                    answer yes for all questions
  --version             show Yum version and exit
  --installroot=[path]  set install root
  --enablerepo=[repo]   enable one or more repositories (wildcards allowed)
  --disablerepo=[repo]  disable one or more repositories (wildcards allowed)
  -x [package], --exclude=[package]
                        exclude package(s) by name or glob
  --obsoletes           enable obsoletes processing during updates
  --noplugins           disable Yum plugins
None
</pre>

OK, yum update does a bunch of stuff, I guess it does an upgrade too.

Uh-oh:
<pre>
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile

  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/threading.py", line 416, in start
    _start_new_thread(self.__bootstrap, ())
thread.error: can't start new thread
</pre>

It works when I use the --noplugins flag. To install [[NGINX]], I added [[EPEL]].

[[CentOS Software Installation]]

### Configuration
Should be the same as any other distribution.

#### Sudo
I get this:
<pre>
audit_log_user_command(): Connection refused
</pre>

#### Service Management
I think it uses /etc/init.d, yes:
<pre>
/etc/init.d/sshd restart
Stopping sshd:                                             [  OK  ]
Starting sshd:                                             [  OK  ]
</pre>

#### Autostart Services
<pre>
chkconfig varnish on
chkconfig nginx on
</pre>
