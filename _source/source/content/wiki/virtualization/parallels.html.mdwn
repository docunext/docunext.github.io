I've used Parallels for about 12 months as of December 2007. It has worked quite
well for what I've needed it for:

* Testing websites in Internet Explorer
* Running Quickbooks

I've been running Windows XP Home in my Parallels virtual machine, on an Intel
iMac.

Hopefully I won't have to do either of those tasks too much longer! Supposedly
Internet Explorer 8 will be more compatible with generally accepted web
standards, but who knows? I personally wouldn't trust Microsoft, but that is
only my personal opinion, based upon nothing else than my own limited experience
in using their software and interacting with them as a small customer. It does
not represent the opinion of my employer circa late 2011.
