VirtualBox is a virtualization system for running virtual machines, it is produced by [[Oracle]]. I haven't tried it in awhile, but since Sun is continuing to release it under the [[GPL]], I'd like to try it again.

I'm glad that [[Lenny]] includes a package for virtualbox modules that is compatible with another [[Lenny]] package that I need - an [[OpenVZ]] [[Kernel]]!
That installed OK, now I'm installing virtualbox-ose:

Grrr...:
<pre>
# virtualbox
Qt WARNING: VirtualBox: cannot connect to X server
</pre>
Can this be used with [[VNC]], like [[QEMU]] and [[KVM]]? YES! No problem, it was a piece of cake with [[tightvncserver]]. I'm trying out [[Nexenta]], hopefully it will run OK!

### Networking
Need to use [[bridge-utils]]. This works for me, just had to do:
<pre>
VBoxAddIF vbox0 root br0
</pre>
(I'm running the vm as root - bad docunext!)

Then on the VirtualBox gui for my vm, I selected host interface, and entered vbox0. (This is described on the Debian Wiki!)

#### Network Device Emulators
The [http://bugs.gentoo.org/232519 VirtualBox open source edition doesn't include the e1000 (doh)], and I'm having trouble getting [[OpenWRT]] to recognize the AMD PC Network interface. Grrr. Is is supported?

### Releasing the mouse
Right arrow key -> and the CNTL key.

### Error message: VirtualBox can't operate in VMX root mode.
<pre>
/etc/init.d/kvm stop

### Virtual Box Guest Tools
When running an [[Ubuntu]] guest on a [[Windows]] host, a colleague suggested I install the VirtualBox guest tools to improve performance. I did - it involved running a script that compiled some custom kernel modules, which afterwards made perfect sense.

The logic behind installing custom [[virtualization]] tools on guests was supported by the fact that [[VMWare]] has guest tools too.
