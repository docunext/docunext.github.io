This seems to be a good setup as [[CentOS]] minimal is fairly minimal.

### My Setup

    sudo vzctl create 111 --ostemplate centos-5-i386-minimal

Turned out there was a lot more to do after that! I had to get yum working,
which was actually pretty challenging, but doable. Once I did that, I did some
cleanup, and then did this:

    tar -czvf /var/lib/vz/template/cache/centos-5-i386-minimal.tar.gz ./

pub-210-st:/var/lib/vz/private# vzctl enter 111

Not bad, eh?
