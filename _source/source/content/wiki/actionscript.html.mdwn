Actionscript is similar to [[Javascript]] and it is used with [[SWF]] movies.

There are three versions of actionscript that I am aware of:

* Actionscript 1: still used by [[Ming]]
* Actionscript 2: object oriented, used in Flash [[SWF]]s version 8. When compiled into a [[SWF]] via [[MTASC]], AS2 gets converted to AS1
* Actionscript 3: used with Flash [[SWF]]s version 9
