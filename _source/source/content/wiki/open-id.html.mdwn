### Open ID Summary
Open ID is a federated or distributed identification system.

### My Experience with Open ID
I setup and Open ID server way back when it was first announced, but I never used it as there weren't too many consumers. These days I use Verisign as the provider, but I use my own domain and url as my id, and delegate the authentication to Verisign.

### OpenID and this Wiki
I've recently setup temporary and experimental Open ID support on this wiki. You can login by clicking the login via openid at the top right hand part of this screen.
