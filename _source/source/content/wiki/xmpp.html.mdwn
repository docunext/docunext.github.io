XMPP is the protocol used by [[Jabber]].

### XMPP Servers==
I've used:
* [[dJabberd]] - this looks awesome, I've only run it a couple of times
* [[eJabberd]] - I use this daily, but have banged my head against the wall several times trying to troubleshoot it.
* [[in.jabberd]] - New! Small! Lightweight!
* [[Prosody]] - My new favorite - written in [[Lua]]!

### XMPP Capable Clients
Most [[Instant Messaging]] clients support multiple protocols. There include support for XMPP:
* [[Adium]]
* [[Pidgin]]
* [[Cabber]]
* [[Mcabber]]

* There's one we use for Windows which I can't remember...
