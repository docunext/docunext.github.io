Debian was founded by Ian, who was dating (and I think is now married to) Debby.
Deb+Ian. 4-EVA. :-) Anyway, Ian now works for Sun I think, and the project
has a complete life of its own. While I don't think its the ultimate meritocracy
that [[/Apache]] claims to be, it has some impressive ideals dedicated to social
values and what I consider social justice.

Debian is supported by thousands of volunteers all over the world, sponsored by
many, and is officially represented by a non-profit company called Software in
the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI).

#### Debian Package Tool

Debian is a really terrific operating system for many reasons, and one of the
most prominent is its advanced package tool (APT).

#### SPI
SPI is the nonprofit organization which manages the Debian project, as well as
several other open source initiatives. I've been meaning to join, but haven't
gotten around to it yet.
