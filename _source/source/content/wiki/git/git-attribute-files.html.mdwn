Git attribute files can be used to tell [[Git]] to treat certain files different.

### binary

This is a macro for "-text -diff".

### export-ignore

The gitattributes [[manual]] page reads: "Files and directories with the attribute export-ignore won't be added to archive files."

But what does that mean, exactly?

Ah - it means that a file can be checked in, but when an archive is generated, the file will not be included. That's not what I was looking for.  Actually [[git]] probably isn't the right tool for what I'm looking for - I want to keep track of events (additions, changes, and deletions) within a file repository, but not maintain revisions of each file, specifically for digital photographs. After doing a little more research, I found [[Unison]] again which is probably better suited to the task.

Still, I'm glad to have learned about git attributes!
