Redmine is a project management system, similar to Trac. Its written in
[[Ruby]] using the [[Ruby on Rails]] framework. It may make it into [[Debian]]
soon, I just noticed an upload to Debian mentors!

### Review
I've recently started using Redmine extensively and am totally impressed. First
of all, its way faster than I'd imagined. I am running it via [[/Apache]] and
[[/Mod fcgid]], using [[/SQLite]] for data storage.

Redmine is configured to only access [[/Git]] repositories, and not surprisingly,
it is configured to work alongside [[/git/Gitosis]] that is configured to control
access to the Git repositories.
