SMTP is used for outgoing and relayed email. The acronym stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol".

### Simple or Enhanced?

In fact, SMTP is *incredibly* simple. So simple that requirements necessitated
an enhanced version, ESMTP, which includes support for users to authenticate
prior to sending email.

### SMTP Specifications

SMTP typically uses port 25, but due to overwhelming amounts of [[/Spam]], many
ISPs block outgoing connections on port 25, forcing SMTP service clients to seek
alternatives, such as port 587.

### SMTP Servers
