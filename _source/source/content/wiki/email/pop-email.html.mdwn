The POP protocol is often used with email accounts provided by internet service
providers for home or personal use. Emails are often removed from the server
after downloading, and there is only one-way synchronization between clients and
the server. These characteristics of email accounts using the POP protocol allow
internet service providers to reasonably limit the amount of storage space each
account requires. It also allows customers to easily retain their emails if they
move or choose to switch to another provider.

There are, however, some drawbacks to email accounts that use the POP protocol.
As mentioned earlier, POP does not have a two-way synchronization mechanism, so
users looking to access their email from multiple computers, devices, or clients
may have difficulties, such as missing emails on one or more devices. Also,
servers are often built using fault-tolerant systems (such as RAID arrays), as
opposed to desktop machines, which can sometimes suffer from higher failure
rates. POP is a standard email protocol that has been around for many years and
is therefore widely available and implemented. It supports secure connections,
including SSL, TLS, CRAM-MD5, among others. It can also be used with services
like fetchmail, to pull email from one mailbox to another.
