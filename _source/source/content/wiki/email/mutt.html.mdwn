Mutt is  command-line email-client. It supports the Maildir format as well as
Mbox for accessing mail locally, though it can also use the [[/Protocols/IMAP]]
protocol. For sending mail, it can use a local sendmail utility, or it can use
[[/email/SMTP]].

Mutt also supports [[/Security/GPG]]!

### Maildir Support
Mutt does support [[maildir]], and with [[offlineimap]], they make a powerful duo.

### Digitally Signing Email
I'm hoping to start digitally signing my emails one of these days, and I found these links which will hopefully help me do so:

I just went through the process using a Freemail certificate from [[thawte]] and [[Icedove]]. Since I mainly use mutt, I still have to set that up. UPDATE: Shortly (a few weeks) after I signed up for the free certificate, [[Thawte]] discontinued their free email certificate program.
