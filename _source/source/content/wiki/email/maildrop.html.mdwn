### Courier Maildrop
Maildrop can be used as a virtual mailbox transport. There are  couple programs with this name, I use the [[Debian]] package [[courier-maildrop]].

This component helps with [[spamassassin]] filtering, as well as vacation autoresponders.

### [[gdbm]]
[[Courier]] maildrop supports [[gdbm]] files! That's awesome, making it much easier to do some fancy filtering with maildroprc.

My maildrop -v responds with this:
<pre>
maildrop 2.0.4 Copyright 1998-2005 Double Precision, Inc.
GDBM/DB extensions enabled.
Courier Authentication Library extension enabled.
Maildir quota extension enabled.

So which is it, [[gdbm]] or [[bdb]]? Its hard to tell unfortunately. In my case, it is using [[gdbm]]. Unfortunately, [[Postfix]] does not support [[gdbm]] at all, so why is courier-maildrop compiled with gdbm?

Looks like [[courier]] is easy to recompile via the [[debian]] package, just changing --with-db=db in debian/rules.
