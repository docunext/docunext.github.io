A "Sender Policy Framework" is a method of authoritatively specifying what IP addresses are authorized to send email for a domain. It is implemented through [[DNS]] as a [[TXT Record]].

## Example SPF Record

<pre class="sh_sh">
"v=spf1 mx a -all"
</pre>

This record says that only [[MX DNS Records]] are allowed to send email for the domain which contains the SPF record.
