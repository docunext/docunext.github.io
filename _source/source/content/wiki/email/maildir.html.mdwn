Gotta start this page because maildirs rock! They are scalable, fast, and reliable. I believe that the Maildir format was developed by [[Daniel J. Berstein]] for use with [[Qmail]].

### Accessing Maildirs
Most of the time, [[IMAP]] servers and clients access maildirs.

### Creating Maildirs
I use [[maildirmake]] to create an initial maildir for a new user, then use an [[IMAP]] client to create sub-folders.

### Maildir Compatible Software
* [[Dovecot]] even created indexes within the maildirs it accesses
* [[Qmail]]
* [[Postfix]]
* [[Courier]]
* [[OfflineIMAP]]
