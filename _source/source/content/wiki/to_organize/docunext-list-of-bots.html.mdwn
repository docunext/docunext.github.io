User-agents are slightly similar but not exactly the same as bots - many bots impersonate browser user-agents.
### User Agents
Note these user-agents are not all bad bots!

[[BDFetch]]

Your logs might show something like this:
<pre>
 193.194.87.131 [11/Nov/2007:21:56:57 -0500] "GET /cacti/cmd.php HTTP/1.0" 301 233 "-" "-"
</pre>
That's a bot which presents no user-agent but is looking for an exploit.
