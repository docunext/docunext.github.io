Atrax ignored the catchall [[robots.txt]] disallow on my server:

<pre>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</pre>

That's reason enough to get banned in my opinion. I added this to my robots.txt file:

<pre>
User-agent: AtraxSolutions
Disallow: /
</pre>

I also added the IP addresses, 174.46.170.185 and 72.13.95.243, from which an Atrax bot came to the "slow lane" (7kbps).
