[[m0n0jabber archive]]

I've switched to using [[djabberd]], and I made a lot of progress on a phing build.xml file for building [[m0n0wall]]-like appliances. Its still far from complete, and for the most part moves the exec commands from m0n0dev.php to a build.xml file, but did find a workaround for the ncurses prompts.

I'll be setting up a [[subversion]] repository and trac for this project very soon. Here's the plan so far:

* Get phing to build a working m0n0wall, or at least booting m0n0wall image - done.
* Include [[perl]] and Djabberd, auto start DJabberd
* Create webGUI necessary to view,add,edit, delete users, reset passwords, and restart DJabberd, also need xml parsing to and from config.xml
* DJabberd will only use the htdigest function for now, maybe other authentication hooks later
* Would be great to have a registration screen, and allow DJabberd users to login and change their passwords. Nice to have, but not critical.

Need to figure out how to convert key value pairs to a [[djabberd conf file]].
