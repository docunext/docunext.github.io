### Xhtml2dom.js.xsl  Summary
I've written an [[XSL]] stylesheet which transforms [[XHTML]] into [[javascript]] dom code. I'm pretty excited about it. Its totally alpha now (March 2009) and I'm integrating into a few applications to test it out and iron out the wrinkles. So far I've only tested it in [[Webkit]] and [[Gecko]], and just a tiny bit in [[MSIE]]. IIRC, it didn't work so well in [[MSIE]].

### My Experience
I was skeptical of this at first, but after using this in practice for a few weeks with some surprisingly complex XHTML, I'm convinced that its a good practice.
