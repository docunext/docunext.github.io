Golang (I can't call it simply "go", just not unique enough) is a programming
language developed by some quality talent at [[/Google]].

I tried it out for the first time in early 2013 and it impressed me; I like that
it results in a static binary and that the compiler can fetch external
libraries. No, I really like that the compiler can fetch external libraries.

I am also impressed with Golang's syntax; the syntax is simple, consice, not
overly strict, and clear. I still have a lot to investigate and learn with
golang.
