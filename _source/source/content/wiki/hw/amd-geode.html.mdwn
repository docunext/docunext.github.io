The AMD Geode is a low power [[CPU]] found in the ALIX series of main boards from [[PC Engines]], as well as many other systems.

### Geode LX
This is the chip found in the [[PC Engines]] systems. It has a security block for accelerated [[encryption]] and a hardware based random number generator for lots of [[entropy]].

Hardware using the AMD Geode LX:
* [[PC Engines]] ALIX
* [[Thecus N3200PRO]]

### Geode NX
The NX series uses more power than the LX series and I believe it has more [[graphics]] features as well. I have a [[thin client]] with this chip, the [[HP t5725]].
