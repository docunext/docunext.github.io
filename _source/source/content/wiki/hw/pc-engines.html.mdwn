### Summary
PC Engines are my favorite small motherboards.

### [[ALIX]]
The [[ALIX]] boards come in a few different formats: mini-itx, and two even smaller versions. The mini-itx board comes with on-board video which is pretty cool. All of them use the [[AMD Geode]] LX [[CPU]] and only consume about 5 watts of power. NICE!

It has a [[cryptography]] chip too!

### WRAP
The wireless router application platform is no longer in production.
