This is a script I found which can be used to create MAC addresses for virtual
machines. I didn't write it, it is distributed under the BSD license:

# 2006-11-06:
#	Version 1.0, first release of EasyMAC!
#
# 2007-07-20:
#	Version 1.1:
#		Added option for _any_ MAC address, not only VMware addresses.
#		Changed output for static/random MAC address. It now tells that these are VMware MAC adresses.
