Middleman is a static web compiler written in [[Ruby]]. I'm using it for one site as of late 2012, but plan to use it for a couple more sites as well.

#### Middleman Features

* Blog plugin
* Gzip build files
* File specific templates
* Uses Bundler

It has some similarities to [[Ruby on Rails]]:

* ERB Templates
* Uses ActiveSupport
