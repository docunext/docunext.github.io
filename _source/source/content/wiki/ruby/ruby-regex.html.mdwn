While people new to [[programming]] may find [[regular expressions]] a little confusing, they are incredibly awesome.

[[Ruby]]'s dot-syntax makes it super easy to use:

<pre class="sh_ruby">
mytext = "This is a test"
puts mytext.gsub("a test","not a test")
</pre>

Results with:
<pre>
This is not a test
</pre>
