This looks very nice, its a server which listens to [[inotify]] events and uses [[rsync]] to replicate local directories to a remote site running an [[rsync]] daemon.

### Lsyncd on [[Debian]]
Lsyncd is available on [[Debian]], but it does not have a configuration file or init script so it must be configured and run manually.

### Lsyncd Example Configuration

<pre class="sh_sh">
&lt;lsyncd version="1">
    &lt;directory>
        &lt;source path="/home/example/tinyldap/"/>
        &lt;target path="192.168.8.38::testing/"/>
    &lt;/directory>
&lt;/lsyncd>
</pre>

After I set this up, I ran lsyncd from the command line, and voila - the files transferred, and any changes I made to the directory transferred to the target host. Sweet!

There is more! More than one target can be specified!!

Alternatively, lsyncd can be run with source and target directories as arguments:

<pre class="sh_sh">
lsyncd [OPTION]... [SOURCE] [TARGET 1] [TARGET 2] ...
</pre>
