I passed up on reviewing this web server for awhile because it hasn't been updated in a couple of years, but I just tried it out and it is a real gem for CGI scripts because it is so super small.

I consider it quite similar to thttpd and mini-httpd, but in my experience it supports /usr/bin/cgi-bin better than thttpd and does not require libssl like mini-httpd.
