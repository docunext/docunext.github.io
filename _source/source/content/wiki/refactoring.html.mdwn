Refactoring, as I understand it, is the process of dividing up software components into smaller, more concise pieces.

I've been doing a lot more of this lately (in 2010), and I'm realizing how incredibly important it is to the software development process. It results in cleaner, easier to maintain code; and that likely results in higher quality code that can be more easily understood by other people.

In a way, its almost like the editing process involved with writing. One major difference is the ability to run tests on newly refactored code. This makes it so much easier!
