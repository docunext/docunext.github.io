OpenSSH is a great implementation of the [[ssh]] service protocol.

### ssh-keygen
Create keys like this:
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t dsa
</pre>

### Client Configuration
I usually edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config and turn on sshagent forwarding:
<pre>
Host *
    ForwardAgent yes
</pre>

I've also started using hostname aliases which makes logging into the same
machine as different users much easier:

<pre><code>
Host fake-hostname
  Hostname real-hostname.com
  User diff
</code></pre>

That way when I <code>ssh fake-hostname</code> it will do so as user diff; the
DNS resolver needs to know nothing about fake-hostname.

### Errors
<pre>
key_type_from_name: unknown key type '-----BEGIN'
</pre>
Check authorized_keys.

### SSH Agent
SSH-agent is a little program which can be used to store authenticated keys
during a session.

### Usage
Running the command ssh-agent will output some text. When I copy this text and
feed it back into the command line, the magic happens: environment variables are
set, and I can then add additional keys using ssh-add.
