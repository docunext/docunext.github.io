I've tried out Sinatra and I love it. Its actually very similar to Nexista in that the sitemap is the application. You start out with something like this:

<pre class="sh_ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'xslt'
require 'sinatra'

sdoc = XML::Document.file('index.xsl')
stylesheet = XSLT::Stylesheet.new(sdoc)

get '/' do
    xml_doc = XML::Document.file('index.xml')
    blah = stylesheet.apply(xml_doc)
    "#{blah}"
end
</pre>

I can imagine transforming an existing [[Nexista]] application sitemap into a Sinatra application with ease!

### Learning How to Use Sinatra
I just found a blog post that suggested reading the Sinatra code. I've looked through it a bunch before, and its a good idea so I'm definitely going to do it again. I've also reviewed a bunch of other sinatra apps, like [[Git-wiki]]. That was very helpful.

### Helpers
I'm writing some helpers for Sinatra:

* [[Sinatra-XSLView]]
* [[Sinatra-Cache]]
* I wish there was a more sophisticated configuration helper for Sinatra - there are, thanks to the [[Ruby Proc]]!
