Great. I just checked the AOpen site and there are new BIOS. While they don't mention my problem exactly, hopefully it will be fixed with the update. Amazing, the bios update worked. I'm no longer getting errors. Should I re-install the Turion? Errr, not today. 75 watts is a lot, but bearable I guess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/turion-on-the-desktop.html\">Turion 64 on the Desktop</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/03/amcc-3ware-9650se-sata-ii-pci-express-raid-card-review.html\">3Ware 9650 Review</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/03/turion-64.html\">Turion 64 Review</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/03/cpu-undervolting-and-underclocking.html\">CPU Undervolting and underclocking</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AOpen Machine Rebuild","date":"June 11th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/06/aopen-machine-rebuild/"}}
