{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Since I spend a lot of my time in front of a computer, I really need to do a better job of getting up and moving around every so often. Supposedly it should be done every 20 minutes or so, but unfortunately that isn't very realistic. Many of the tasks which I focus on require my attention for longer periods of time. If I were to break my concentration to walk around for one minute, it would require a lot more time to get back into focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I'm going to make a concerted effort to move around more often while I compute. There are some software applications to help with this, but I'm not going to go there. I do not want to be interrupted while I'm working.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Move Around","date":"November 21st, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-11-21-move-around/"}}
