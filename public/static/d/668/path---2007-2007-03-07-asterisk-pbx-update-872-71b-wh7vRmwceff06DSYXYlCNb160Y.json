{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The time has come for me to upgrade my Asterisk PBX hardware and configuration. Currently, our local area network server is a \"swiss army knife\" of services: file sharing, routing (nat), pbx, and im. While I thought this might be efficient, it is not. So I'm trying a different route, installing each component on separate hardware.</p>\n<h3>Asterisk PBX Hardware</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://metrix.net/metrix-pbx-i-kit-p-15.html\">Metrix PBX I Kit</a> looked pretty good, but upon further consideration, I need more performance capabilities.</p>\n<p>Then there is the MSI Axis 700 for $179 at Newegg.com, or the ASUS Terminator T1 for $74 at Newegg.com. Since I won't have serious voip volume, I'm going to go with the lower priced Terminator T1. Plus, I think I have RAM for it already! To keep the power consumption as low as possible, I'm planning to use a 2gb compact flash card instead of a hard drive. I also bought a <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813153052\"> JetWay J7F3E-PB Socket A (Socket 462) SiS 741CX Mini ITX AMD Motherboard</a> for another server, not sure what yet!</p>\n<h3>Asterisk PBX Software</h3>\n<p>The beauty of Asterisk is that it is licensed under the GPL, so it has plenty of variations and distributions: <b>AstLinux</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/24210/72/1/6/\">How To: Building an Embedded Asterisk PBX</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/AstLinux+Users+Guide+Chapter+1\">AstLinux Users Guide</a><b>freePBX</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.freepbx.org/\">freePBX Home Page</a></p>\n<p>Freepbx looks great because I can run it on ubuntu, my distro of choice.
