It might be advantageous to allow users to maintain the same passwords across boards, but I don't want registration on one board to grant permissions across all accessible boards. So, there is obviously more development to do, but the major hurdles for multi-site support are good to go.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"0.3 Closer than I thought","date":"April 7th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/04/03-closer-than-i-thought/"}}
