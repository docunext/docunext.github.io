{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Files that end in \".pptx\" and \".ppt\" are Microsoft PowerPoint files (unless they are improperly named, of course).</p>\n<p>The \".pptx\" file extension indicates that the file ware saved in Microsoft's XML-based file format, whereas the the \".ppt\" format indicates that it was saved in earlier versions of Microsoft's file format.</p>\n<p>If I understand correctly, newer versions of Powerpoint automatically use the pptx format. Unfortunately, older, but still recent, versions of Powerpoint are unable to open pptx files.</p>\n<p>Thankfully OpenOffice, a free and open source office productivity tool, can open and save in both formats. Today I used \"ooimpress\" to do just that. The only problem I had was due to a missing font, so I simply made some adjustments and saved in the ppt format.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I just received confirmation that the Windows user who was unable to open the .pptx file was able to open the .ppt file that I converted with OpenOffice!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Convert a .pptx File to a .ppt File","date":"November 19th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/11/convert-a-pptx-file-to-a-ppt-file/"}}
