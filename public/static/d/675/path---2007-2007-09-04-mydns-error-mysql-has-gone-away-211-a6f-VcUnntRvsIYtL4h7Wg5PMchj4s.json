MyDNS on the other hand is connecting to another local mysql server on port 3306, and I was using \":3306\" at the end of the host specification. For some reason, that caused problems. I switched the port in my.cnf back to 3306 and then removed the :3306 from the mydns.conf file and things seem to be working better.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MyDNS Error MySQL has gone away","date":"September 4th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-09-04-mydns-error-mysql-has-gone-away/"}}
