{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>More Thoughts on Intel's Little Valley Mini-ITX Board</strong></p>\n<p>The Intel D201GLY mini-itx mainboard I ordered arrived today. This little board has got me very excited. It is small, low-cost (around $80), low-power, and still has a lot going for it. While some are complaining about the SiS graphics chip, or the active CPU cooling fan, I'm more concerned with the 1GB limit on RAM. I would much prefer the ability to stack 2 or more gigabytes of RAM in there.</p>\n<p>What else do I like about this board? I like that it has the following technical specifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>533mhz front side bus</li>\n<li>512KiB Level two cache (Celeron 215)</li>\n<li>On-board Broadcom ethernet chipset</li>\n<li>PCI Slot</li>\n<li>No SATA, Firewire, or unnecessary fluff (there are other boards for that stuff)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Buying Memory for the Little Valley?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>One 240-pin DDR2 SDRAM Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) sockets</li>\n<li>Support for DDR2 533 MHz and DDR2 400 MHz DIMMs</li>\n<li>Support for up to 1 GB of system memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this board is nothing fancy: it's just going to work very well. With the relatively fast bus and decent sized L2 cache, the system should have very low latency for small (hint: web-based) tasks.</p>\n<p>My plan is to first test the average power consumption of this board. I hope it will consume less than 25 watts of power with a ram chip, a 3.5\" hard drive, and an additional 10/100 ethernet card, but that might be too much to ask for. 35 watts would be acceptable. Much more than that and I'll stick with the Via C7-M, which has very low power consumption, but a much smaller cache and possibly slower fsb.</p>\n<p>Next, I will ensure that the on-board ethernet adapter is supported by linux and freebsd. If so, the board will be a candidate for m0n0wall based installations, as well as high-availability clusters.</p>\n<p>At that point, I'll add another ethernet card, likely a 3Com 3C509, known for its reliability, stability, and solid performance.</p>\n<p>Depending on whether the box is destined to be an embedded network appliance (i.e. m0n0wall-based), or a web / database / file server, I'll either pair it with a hard drive or a disk-on-module.</p>\n<p>Is this fun or what?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/intel-little-valley-photos.html\">Intel Little Valley D201GLY Pictures</a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"D201GLY Intel s Little Valley Mini ITX Board","date":"2007-06-22T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-06-22-intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board/"}}
