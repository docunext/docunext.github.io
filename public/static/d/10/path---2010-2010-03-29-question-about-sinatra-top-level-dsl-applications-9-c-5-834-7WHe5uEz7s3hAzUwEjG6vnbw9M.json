{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've just send a question to the Sinatra mailing list:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\nHello,\n<p>Would it be possible to sub-class or mixin an app designed at the top level of the Sinatra DSL into a Sinatra::Base subclass?</p>\n<p>For example, I'm impressed with Nesta and want to work with it some more, but I'm used to working with apps developed as a subclass of Sinatra::Base. I've previously forked Nesta and modified it into a subclass. That worked OK but I ran into some unrelated issues, and am finding the task of keeping in line with the upstream git repo daunting.</p>\n<p>The Mickey Mouse hacker in me would try slurping the file and eval'ing it within a module. That has serious limitations, though.</p>\n<p>I'd venture to guess that there is a more elegant solution. Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>--\n<a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/\">http://www.docunext.com/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/\">http://www.docunext.com/blog/</a></p>\n</pre></blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Question about Sinatra top level DSL Applications"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-03-29-question-about-sinatra-top-level-dsl-applications/"}}
