{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3 id=\"toc0\">RAID Controllers</h3><p>I've been looking into RAIDs for awhile. I've used an Adaptec and a 3Ware raid controller for awhile and found them very useful and high quality with great support in linux.</p>\n<p>Since then, I've found that there are a few other options:</p>\n<ul>    <li>Full software RAID in linux using the md tool</li>    <li>Pseudo fakeraid using a bios-powered raid using a tool called dm</li></ul><p>The choice here is clear: if you are using a dual-boot setup with Windows, you cannot go with a full software RAID solution, you have to use dm or a hardware controller. If you don't have to dual boot with Windows, definitely use the software raid. I also use a software raid on my mac.
