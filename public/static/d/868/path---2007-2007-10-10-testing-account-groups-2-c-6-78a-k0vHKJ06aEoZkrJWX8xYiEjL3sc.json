I first wrote the tests using the IDE then I moved the tests onto the server and into the test suite.

I am not sure what the problem is seeing as how the IDE ran the tests without a problem.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing Account Groups"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-10-10-testing-account-groups/"}}
