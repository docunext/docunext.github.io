{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Debian is my favorite distribution, but I still need to make some changes to the kernel. I add these patches: * ocf-linux* acpi-dsdt patch* openvz patch</p>\n<p>And I turn off a whole bunch of modules I don't need to save on space and compile times. Not all those patches work with the debian source linux kernel, so I downloaded one from kernel.org. Well, they didn't work with 2.6.22 in general, so I stepped down to 2.6.18, which is too bad because it doesn't include the Via C7 processor type. :-(</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Kernel Patches","date":"October 8th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-10-08-debian-kernel-patches/"}}
