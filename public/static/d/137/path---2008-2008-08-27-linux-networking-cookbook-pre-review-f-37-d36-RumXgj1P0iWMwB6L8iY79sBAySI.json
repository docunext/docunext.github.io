{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm currently reading the \"Linux Networking Cookbook\", by Carla Schroder. I chose this book as I'm constantly working with networks, primarily with linux workstations and notebooks, Mac OS X desktops, as well as FreeBSD based (pfSense and m0n0wall) firewalls and routers.</p>\n<p>While pfSense and m0n0wall make setting up a firewall and VPN pretty easy, I stil have many questions about routing, sub-netting and network architecture best practices. I hope by reading this book, I'll gain a better understanding of how \"good\" networks are built, and how to avoid potential problems with an uncertain future about how a network will evolve and be used.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Networking Cookbook Pre Review","date":"2008-08-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-08-27-linux-networking-cookbook-pre-review/"}}
