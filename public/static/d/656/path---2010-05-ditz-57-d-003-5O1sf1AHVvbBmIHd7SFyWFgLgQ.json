{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Simple Defects, the distributed issue tracking system written in Perl with hooks into Git, has been on my radar screen for awhile. I've installed it and run a few tests and it worked well, but I just don't have the familiarity I want to have with Perl yet.</p>\n<p>I started to look around for a Ruby-based equivalent to SD and found <a href=\"http://tommorris.org/blog/2010/04/26\">this article by Tom Morris</a>.</p>\n<p>I haven't fully tested it out yet, but it sounds terrific. Its open source, and the code is available at Gitorious:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ditz\">http://gitorious.org/ditz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/docunext/ditz\">http://github.com/docunext/ditz</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its a Ruby forge project too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ditz.rubyforge.org/\">http://ditz.rubyforge.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>More pages about ditz:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://all-thing.net/old26\">http://all-thing.net/old26</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hmm... I've run into a little trouble with ditz:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nmultiple assignment in conditional (SyntaxError)\n</pre>\n<p>I've forked it and might have fixed the issues.... DOH!</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\n/home/albertlash/src/docu-ditz/lib/ditz.rb:71:in `run_pager': uninitialized constant PLATFORM (NameError)\n</pre>\n<p>It has to do with WIN32 so I just deleted it, but actually I'll comment it out. Yup, looks like its working OK now....</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tracker.rubyforge.org/\">Tracker</a> looks nice too!</p>\n<p>Looking around at ditz some more I see its actually quite an interesting little package. It uses yaml for marshalling / serializing the issue objects in the git repository. With respect to Git, I really like the idea of <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2010/01/lets-use-flat-files-for-storage.html\">using flat files for storage</a>, and even combining files to keep management simpler. With a command line parser / interface, it totally makes sense.</p>\n<p>But why YAML? Personally I would have preferred XML or JSON, but not a problem - it might even be possible to change which serialization method it uses.</p>\n<p>Ooooh - there is a fresher fork of ditz stuff (and patches too):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/ohac/ditz\">http://github.com/ohac/ditz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/ohac/ditz-patches\">http://github.com/ohac/ditz-patches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looks like there might even be a sinatra app in there!</p>\n<p>Another good reason I like JSON:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://rdoc.info/projects/brianmario/yajl-ruby\">http://rdoc.info/projects/brianmario/yajl-ruby</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>CONCLUSION: I think Ditz just might be the direction I want to go!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ditz the Ruby Git Issue Tracker and Ruby 1.9.1","date":"May 1st, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/05/ditz/"}}
