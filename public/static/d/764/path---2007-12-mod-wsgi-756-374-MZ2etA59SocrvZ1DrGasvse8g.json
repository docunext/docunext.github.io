I agree - running web apps as daemons via a server like apache is terrific. Currently I use mod</em>fcgid and it works good with psyco. Python is indeed good stuff, so far I've used fail2ban, cacheability engine,  and trac, but that's about it. Some of it still seems a little weird, but its growing on me. I guess PEAR is just as weird as egg. Cool post about the apt python tool for debian too - thanks for that. </blockquote></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"mod wsgi","date":"December 8th, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/12/mod-wsgi/"}}
