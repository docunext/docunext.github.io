{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Yay! I'm switching to using linux on a notebook! My Macbook has been acting erratic and before it goes I decided to switch to ubuntu / debian. Right now I'm typing on a debian-based laptop. It took me the past day and a half to get everything going, but I think it's boding well!</p>\n<p>I actually built two - one has a dual boot: ubuntu gutsy and windows xp home. The other is the debian, built with a custom kernel. Both are running the xfce4 window manager. I've got wireless working on both too which is pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>I'm able to run jEdit which is fantastic. I also installed dmz-cursor-theme, pidgin, and bluefish.</p>\n<p>Thanks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.suares.an/index.php?topic=jedit\">http://www.suares.an/index.php?topic=jedit</a></p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Linux on Noteooks"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-01-24-linux-on-noteooks/"}}
