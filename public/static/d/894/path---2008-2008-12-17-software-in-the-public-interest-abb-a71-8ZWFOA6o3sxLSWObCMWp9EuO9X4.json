I went to the website and can't find a \"join\" link anywhere. Is donating the same as joining? I seem to remember you posting something about how it was only $25 to join. Did I mis-read a post? Thanks for any information you might have.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah I also wanted to ask you if you would consider using <a href=\"http://www.pbooks.org/\">PBooks</a> for bookkeeping if I changed the license to GPLv2, Apache, or something else you might recommend.</p>\n<p>Thanks again.</blockquote></p>\n<p>Well actually I posted that as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.news.software.coop/spi-december-2008/415/\">MJ's blog</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: MJ responded quickly with the right information, so I joined, and my application was approved. Now I'd like to become a contributing member, so I'll have to supply more information. FYI, the link to apply for membership is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://members.spi-inc.org/newnm.php\">https://members.spi-inc.org/newnm.php</a></p>\n<p>And its free to join, but donations are always welcome!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software in the Public Interest"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-12-17-software-in-the-public-interest/"}}
