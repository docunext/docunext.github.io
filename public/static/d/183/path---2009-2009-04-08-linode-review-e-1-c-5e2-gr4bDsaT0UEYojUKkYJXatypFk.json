{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Its been over a year since I first signed on with Linode, and I figure its time for a quick review.</p>\n<p>My overall experience has been very positive. I have increased my account to include an extra 100GB of traffic per month as well as an additional IP address (for a maximum of two).</p>\n<p>The only problem I had, and it was a very minor problem, was the change from eth1 to eth0:1 for my private IP address. It only took a moment to change, but still it doesn't seem like it was necessary.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking of trying out Linode, I hope you find my review helpful. Let me know if you have any questions. Note - I have no affiliation with Linode other than being a customer.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Linode Review","date":"2009-04-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-04-08-linode-review/"}}
