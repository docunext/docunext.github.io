{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm so pleased with my brief experience with Ruby that I've decided to make it my primary language of choice.</p>\n<p>I've taken my time getting started with Ruby, ramping up only recently, and I've found it to be a very comfortable ride. What lies ahead seems a little foreign, but I have a feeling that its going to be a very enjoyable learning process.</p>\n<p>So far there have been very few hurdles. Here are some that I've encountered:</p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.5625em;\"><b>Include a Ruby file within another Ruby file</b></font>\nSounds easy, right? Well it is easy, but there is a little gotcha which had me hung up for awhile. Say I have a file which creates a variable, and I want to include that file into another, and then reference that variable. That is very much doable, but not the way I was trying to do so.</p>\n<p>I've recently gotten in the habit of using local variables quite a lot in my ruby scripts, like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">barf = \"blah\"</pre>Simple and easy. However, if I put that into barf.rb and then do this in blah.rb:\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">load \"barf.rb\"\nputs barf</pre>I get an error about an unknown variable barf. I'm not sure if its possible to reference that local variable with some prefix of sorts, but I have discovered that this:\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">$barf = \"blah\"</pre>and\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">load \"barf.rb\"\nputs $barf</pre>works fine. The $ makes it a global variable, and the @@ works too.\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.5625em;\"><b>eRuby is an external binary</b></font>\nI tried out ERB, and then I read that eRuby is like ERB, but coded in C. Cool! How do I use it? It may be like ERB in that it can parse templates with ERB-comparible syntax, but it isn't a ruby object which can be instantiated like</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_ruby\">barf = ERB.new()</pre>\n<p>I guess its used more as a we server filter, like with mod_ruby or similar. This can make Ruby behave a little like PHP, which some people may appreciate.</p>\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=inforbanki-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1934356085&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr\" style=\"width: 120px; height: 240px; float: right; margin-left: 12px;\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\nAlso a big thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/\">pragmatics guide to Ruby</a>. Its a good read and I may just pick up the pickaxe version for Ruby 1.9!\n<p>Ruby version 1.9 is still very new, and this book has already received 62 reviews for an average of 4.5 / 5 stars! That is very impressive.</p>\n<p>I have a book on using Ruby for systems administration. I should re-read that before buying another book though.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby it is then","date":"August 7th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/08/ruby-it-is-then/"}}
