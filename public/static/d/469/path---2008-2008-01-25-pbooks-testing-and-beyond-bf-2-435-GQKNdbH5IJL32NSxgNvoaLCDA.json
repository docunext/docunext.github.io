{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>For the majority of my short testing career I have mainly dealt with working out the bugs and errors for our <a href=\"http://www.pbooks.org\">pbooks site</a>.  It has been a good experience, I have learned a lot through manual testing, test suites, and the use of the Selenium IDE.  Testing is vital when it comes to designing a new website or making a new program.  When you correct one thing, something else may break.  You also have to test hundreds of combinations as if you were a new user, in order to make sure all aspects of the program or website work properly.</p>\n<p>My experience with PBooks has given me a good understanding of the testing process.  I wouldn't say that testing is difficult, but there is a lot more to it than one may think.  I am looking forward to using these skills on future projects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pbooks Testing and Beyond"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-01-25-pbooks-testing-and-beyond/"}}
