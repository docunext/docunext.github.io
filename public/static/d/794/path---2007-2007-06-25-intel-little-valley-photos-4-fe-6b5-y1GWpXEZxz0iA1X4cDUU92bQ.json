{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Here's a perspective shot of the Little Valley, with some common items nearby to get an idea of the relative size.</p>\n<h3>Little Valley Height</h3>\n<p>One thing I wanted to know about the Little Valley was its height. Its doesn't appear anywhere I could find in the intel docs, so I measured it. To the top of the heatsink / cooling fan it is 2\". Because the CPU is actively cooled, meaning it uses the fan, you'll want to have the casing higher than that. How high? I don't know, it would depend on the application and ambient temperature.</p>\n<h3>Little Valley SATA</h3>\n<p>WHOA! I just noticed that there are spots for SATA plugs at the bottom of the board! That is very interesting indeed.</p>\n<h3>Little Valley Power Connectors</h3>\n<p>Other things of interest, the board does have a 4-pin power connector in addition to the 20 pin power supply connector, unlike some other mini-itx boards.</p>\n<h3>\"DUGLY\" - The D201GLY Nickname?</h3>\n<p>In the spirit of the mighty slug (aka Linksys NSLU2), I propose we nickname the D201GLY the \"DUGLY\". We have intel to thank for the terrific model number to build off of. :-)</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intel D201GLY Little Valley Photos and Height"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-06-25-intel-little-valley-photos/"}}
