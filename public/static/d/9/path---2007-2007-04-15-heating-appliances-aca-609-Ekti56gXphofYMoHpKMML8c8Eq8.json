{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The heating, ventilation, and cooling in my office is far from optimal. I did make some improvements, including installing and sealing a better filter, double checking the wiring on my thermostat, and adjusting the flow of air to the most needed areas. Nevertheless, the environment is not the best.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity, I did a little research on space heaters. They are cheap, but very expensive to run, not to mention a little dangerous. I found an interesting kind of space heater that I'd never heard of before: oil-filled. These are supposedly more efficient, and I'm assuming safer because of the way they operate (they never really get \"super\" hot). However, there was a <a href=\"http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml05/05094.html\">2005 recall of Lakewood brand oil filled space heaters for ruptured welds</a>. Other reviews mention the same problem: oil leaking from the radiators.</p>\n<p>My goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe, cheap heat</li>\n<li>Quick and focused</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The oil-filled heaters from Honeywell and Delonghi look pretty good and get decent reviews. I would like to get a small one, but the radiator style seem much more common.</p>\n<p>I'd also like to get a hygrometer, maybe the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EX83RU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=inforbanki-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000EX83RU\">Honeywell TM005X Wireless Thermo-Hygrometer</a>\n<img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=inforbanki-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000EX83RU\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />?</p>\n<p>Yesterday my neighbor was getting his heater replaced and I heard some banging around on the ventilation system so I investigated. I found that one of my vents was not connected, so I sealed it up with some duct tape. This and the new filters I bought a few weeks ago (2\" instead of 1\") make the HVAC system much more effective. Previously there was a giant gap at the inlet of the heater, which I'm sure sucked in a lot of cold air from the basement. Hopefully this will make a difference when my electric bill arrives!</p>\n<p>The new \"furnace filters\" are also a higher quality than what I was using before so there will be less dust around the office, and I only have to change them once every three months. The next filter change will take place in July 2007.</p>\n<p>On the same subject, I just emailed this to my dad:</p>\n<blockquote>I recently bought some new filters for the furnace (electric). The old one was 1\" wide, and the opening was 2\", so I bought 2\". It fits nice and snug, but there were some gaps on the side so I duct taped them up (first time I used duct tape for the intended purpose!). While I was at it, I noticed one of the intake pipes was disconnected from the vent, so I put it back together and duct taped that together as well. Those two minor patches have made a big difference already.</blockquote>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/november-2006/heating-your-home--safely-11-06/overview/1106_heat_ov.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=2&amp;searchTerm=space%20heater\">ConsumerReports.org Safey Guide for Electric Heaters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.air-n-water.com/heater-space_info.htm\">http://www.air-n-water.com/heater-space_info.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.alternative-heating-info.com/\">http://www.alternative-heating-info.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.worldvillage.com/home/my_favorite_oil_filled_heater.html\">http://blog.worldvillage.com/home/my_favorite_oil_filled_heater.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.informedheating.com/blog/\">http://www.informedheating.com/blog/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Heating appliances vs Heat Pump Electric Heat","date":"2007-04-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-04-15-heating-appliances/"}}
