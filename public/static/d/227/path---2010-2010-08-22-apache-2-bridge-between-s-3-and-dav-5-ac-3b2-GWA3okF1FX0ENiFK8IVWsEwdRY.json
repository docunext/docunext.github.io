{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Experimenting with Apache, mod_perl, Apache2::S3, and DAV</h2>\n<p>I'm going to set this up today and see if this item on my \"to-do\" list works:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2010/08/to-do-test-apache2s3-as-a-dav-proxy-with-davfs2.html\" class=\"h3 strong\">To-Do: Test Apache2::S3 as a DAV Proxy with DAVFS2</a></p>\n<p>Alas, it didn't work. I didn't use davfs2, but actually that's what encouraged me to try this today! After tinkering around the <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2010/08/some-ubuntu-customizations-im-using-with-lucid-lynx-1004.html\">Lucid Lynx Ubuntu system</a> I recently setup on my <a href=\"http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2010/08/review-of-the-lenovo-g555.html\">Lenovo G555</a> I noticed something that sounded familiar but hadn't actually seen before: <strong>.gvfs</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What is GVFS?</h2>\n<p>GVFS is the successor to the Gnome virtual file system. Thankfully, it doesn't need the usual hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and is apparently very modular, kind of like PAM. I happened upon the hidden .gvfs folder in my home directory while trying to clean it up, with a goal of putting all my settings in $XDG<em>CONFIG</em>HOME (aka ~/.config). Would I want to delete .gvfs? Turns out I definitely want to keep it -- in my humble opinion it is a very very cool little folder! Not so much for what it as a folder does, but for what it alerted me to - the brand new world of GVFS at large.</p>\n<p>On my Lucid Lynx install, I have these gvfs related packages installed:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_sh\">\nlash@lenovo-g555-2:~$ dpkg -l | grep gvfs\nii  gvfs                                  1.6.1-0ubuntu1build1                            userspace virtual filesystem - server\nii  gvfs-backends                         1.6.1-0ubuntu1build1                            userspace virtual filesystem - backends\nii  gvfs-bin                              1.6.1-0ubuntu1build1                            userspace virtual filesystem - binaries\nii  gvfs-fuse                             1.6.1-0ubuntu1build1                            userspace virtual filesystem - fuse server\nii  libgvfscommon0\n</pre>\n<p>Get the idea? Good! I'll elaborate anyway! Docunext readers may be familiar with <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/FUSE\">FUSE</a>, I know I am - I've been using SSHFS to mount filesystems over the SSH protocol for years, though I've been using NFS more often these days. I still use FUSE all the time for Encfs, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, from what I've learned so far, gvfs is a set of tools, abstraction layers, and programming interfaces to provide tighter integration of FUSE, as well as other filesystem backends, with Gnome. While reading up on gvfs, I discovered that <a href=\"http://thiblahute.blogspot.com/2010/01/good-news-about-google-documents-gvfs.html\">Thibault Saunier is working on a Google Docs interface to gvfs</a>! Believe in the gDrive! The <a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2010/08/droid-x-review.html\">gPhone</a> came true!!</p>\n<p>This got me thinking and reminded me that I wanted to try connecting S3 to DAV with Apache2::S3. But as my test confirmed, that won't work at all:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_log\">\n[Sun Aug 22 18:07:02 2010] [error] [client 192.168.1.215] &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\\n&lt;Error>&lt;Code>MethodNotAllowed&lt;/Code>&lt;Message>The specified method is not allowed against this resource.&lt;/Message>&lt;ResourceType>BUCKET&lt;/ResourceType>&lt;Method>PROPFIND&lt;/Method>&lt;RequestId>B0DA9D7EE6DE73AD&lt;/RequestId>&lt;AllowedMethod>PUT&lt;/AllowedMethod>&lt;HostId>tIbZEhZarXoApiO9wzD23fLIrGiYqZ+DKhUxiFYXmG5frXO6faXdpOLgGEAx2Fwc&lt;/HostId>&lt;/Error> at /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/Apache2/S3.pm line 153.\\n\n</pre>\n<p>So, it looks like S3FS it the best bet, though that one definitely needs some more work, too.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Apache2 Bridge Between S3 and DAV"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/2010-08-22-apache2-bridge-between-s3-and-dav/"}}
