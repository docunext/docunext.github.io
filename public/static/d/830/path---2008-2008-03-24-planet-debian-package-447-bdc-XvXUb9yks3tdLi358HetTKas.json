{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As regular readers of Docunext know, one of my favorite websites is <a href=\"http://planet.debian.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Debian</a>. While perusing some debian packages last night, I realized that the software which powers <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/planet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Debian is actually a debian package itself</a>. Its pleasant surprises like that are what always impresses me about debian - it is a great group of people and they are constantly willing to share what makes them great with whoever is interested.</p>\n<p>So I tried out \"planet\" and its super easy to get going. Here's what I did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>apt-get install planet</li>\n<li>vim /etc/planet.conf - added a [<a href=\"http://www.example.com/feed/%5C\">http://www.example.com/feed/\\</a>] section at the bottom</li>\n<li>cd /var/www/</li>\n<li>ln -s /var/lib/planet/www/ ./planet/</li>\n<li>planetplanet /etc/planet.conf</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It worked! Right off the bat I'm wary to learn another template language / syntax though, so I'm wondering how easy / difficult it would be to use <strong>XSLT</strong> as the rendering engine. Hmmmm.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Planet Debian Package","date":"March 24th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-03-24-planet-debian-package/"}}
