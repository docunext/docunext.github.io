{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ncache is a caching module for nginx, similar to varnish. I just installed it using my modified nginx debian build script, and it was a little tough to get going.

It defaults to /usr/local/nginx. As a temporary workaround, I created /usr/local/nginx/logs/ and chowned to www-data. That fixed the problem.</p>\n<p>Another small issue I ran into was the shell script to create the cache directories, but thankfully someone contributed a <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ncache/issues/detail?id=32\" rel=\"nofollow\">solution</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll probably fork this and make lots of changes to learn more about caching and nginx modules. I've added a wiki page about it <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/NGINX_ncache_module\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I still had problems getting this to work. :-(</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NCache is an NGINX Module for Caching Proxied HTTP Responses","date":"March 1st, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/03/ncache/"}}
