With a 24MB swap, 84MB boot partition, and the rest for root. I've been able to install ejabberd in it, and that alone makes it a very useful appliance.</li><li>1GB debian install - this is about as small as you can go with a debian gui. I've installed fluxbox on it and its working great!</li></ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"QEMU virtual machines and appliances","date":"2007-07-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-15-qemu-virtual-machines-appliances/"}}
