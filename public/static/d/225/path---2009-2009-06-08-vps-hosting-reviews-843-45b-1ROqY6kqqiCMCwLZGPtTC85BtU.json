{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm happy to say that I signed up for a RapidXen account and I'm very pleased. I think its one of the best deals out there. My only complaint is that there seem to be some zombie machines hitting the server - perhaps because the last inhabitant of the ip address was setup insecurely? Who knows.</p>\n<p>I've also signed up for a VPSLink OpenVZ account, which I'm not too pleased with. I've used them before and found the performance to be lacking. I had signed up for this because they offer a lot of bandwidth, but I'm afraid its Dreamhost type of deal: the server isn't fast enough to deliver the bandwidth promised.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I also signed up for a VPSVille.ca account and I'm also quite pleased with it. I chose their facility in the United Kingdom and its nice and speedy.</p>\n<p>I still want to try out a prgrm.com account.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"VPS Hosting Reviews","date":"2009-06-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-06-08-vps-hosting-reviews/"}}
