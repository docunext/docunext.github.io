{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm revamping an old Sinatra app I built and unfortunately I'm running into this odd error:</p>\n<pre class=\"terminal\">\ncan't convert Pathname to String (TypeError)\n</pre>\n<p>It was occurring due to the octopussy gem, which I believe uses the httparty gem.</p>\n<p>I haven't figured it out yet, but based upon some initial searches, it looks like this has to do with rubygems in some way.

In fact I've made a lot of improvements to those experiments lately; representing a much more important change to that game. In particular, I'm now using the amazon_product gem by <a href=\"https://github.com/hakanensari/amazon_product\">hakanensari</a> instead of the older ruby-aaws gem (that apparently doesn't work with Amazon's new query requirements). I also updated the mongo gem, which resulted in having to use BSON::ObjectId instead of Mongo::ObjectID.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, for both gems, I had wrapped the interface with svxbox, so I was able to swap out the gem and the method in only one place. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"can t convert Pathname to String TypeError","date":"2011-09-13T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2011/2011-09-13-cant-convert-pathname-to-string-typeerror/"}}
