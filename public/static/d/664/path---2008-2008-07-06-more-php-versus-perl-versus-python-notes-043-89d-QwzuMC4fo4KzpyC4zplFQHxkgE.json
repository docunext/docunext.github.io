{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've been working with PHP for a long time, and more recently and intensely, Perl and Python. I like all three languages, but since I've heard PHP get bashed so much, I have to say in some ways I expected more from Perl and Python.</p>\n<p>They are very nice, but for my uses, all three languages are fairly similar. I'm doing web development using SQL, XML and XSL, so I'd probably end up seeing a bigger difference using Postgres over MySQL, or Xalan-C instead of libxslt.</p>\n<p>I've been unable to measure memory consumption of PHP and Python, but for mod_perl I've been using GTop to measure memory consumption. I've been able to measure te execution time requests on each platform, but I only see those numbers as relevant for self comparison, meaning I won't use those numbers to say one language is faster than another in my context, because I can't be sure that the start and stop points are the same within each program.</p>\n<p>I have noted a few things in my experience:* mod<em>perl is good for integrating with Apache. Duh!* python and mod</em>wsgi is nice for controlling application setups from apache, and the wsgi interface is nice, but otherwise it seems quite similar to mod<em>fcgid* PHP is of course a very convenient language for getting things going, used with xcache and mod</em>fcgid, the performance is quite nice too</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"More PHP versus Perl versus Python Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-07-06-more-php-versus-perl-versus-python-notes/"}}
