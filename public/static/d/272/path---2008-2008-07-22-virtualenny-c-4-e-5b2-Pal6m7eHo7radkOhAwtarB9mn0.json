Looks like 2.6.26 is the way to go! I'm also looking forward to having a distro I can manage and maintain for awhile.</p>\n<p>Etch was released while I first became accustomed to Debian and its release process, so I wasn't aware how much care is taken to stability. Inasmuch, I've been embracing testing and unstable for awhile. I'm eager to stick with lenny for at least a few years on my production servers. I'll continue use testing and unstable on my desktop.</p>\n<p>But anyway, back to VirtuaLenny, 2.6.26 is going to bring not only openvz to lenny, but also xen and kvm. I'm planning to build a xen machine very soon.</p>\n<p>Â¥</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"VirtuaLenny"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-07-22-virtualenny/"}}
