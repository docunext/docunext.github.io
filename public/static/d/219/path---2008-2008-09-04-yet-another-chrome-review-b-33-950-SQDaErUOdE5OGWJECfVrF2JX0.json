Its a simple laptop, an <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Everex_Notebooks\">Everex NC1500</a> which came with XP Home. I installed Ubuntu on it, and kept XP Home to do testing from time to time. Since <a href=\"http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/2008/09/01/lets-hope-for-google-chrome/\">Google's Chrome browser</a> doesn't work in linux yet, I downloaded and installed it on XP Home.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but it didn't seem much better than Firefox. Hopefully Firefox (and Iceweasel) will get to benefit from Chrome, at least by creating a multi-threaded process and a faster javascript engine. As a developer, one of my favorite things about Firefox is that it is cross-platform. Webkit is getting there, but still isn't there yet.</p>\n<p>How will Chrome help developers? My guess is that it will mostly have to do with javascript, and their V8 engine. How does it stack up against the SquirrelFish?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Google_Chrome\">Docunext Wiki Page on Google Chrome</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Yet Another Chrome Review","date":"2008-09-04T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-09-04-yet-another-chrome-review/"}}
