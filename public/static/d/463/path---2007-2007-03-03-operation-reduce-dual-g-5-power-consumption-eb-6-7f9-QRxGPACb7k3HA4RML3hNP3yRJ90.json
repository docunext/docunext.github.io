Instead, I'll just do everything I can to make sure the machine is lean as can be. Here are a couple initial ideas:</p>\n<ul><li>Turn off wake-on-lan (wake for administrator access)</li><li>Remove second graphics card (only using two displays now anyway)</li><li>Remove the modem</li><li>Reduce processor performance</li><li>Enable every energy saving option there is!</li></ul>\n<p>The dual-G5 does use a lot of energy: about <strong>144 watts</strong> at idle, with no display. Add a display or two and you're up over 200. That's with one graphics card, (4) 512MB ram chips, 1 sata drive, and a mouse and keyboard. Also, I set the processor to \"reduced\" performance. The \"spin down hard disks when possible\" option didn't seem to do much. Putting the computer to sleep reduced its power consumption to about 5 watts. <b>Dual G4 Powermac</b></p>\n<p>I was glad to find that the Dual-G4 fares better - though its obviously slower. Mine runs at about 80 watts without a display or any usb peripherals. With some tweaking, I might be able to get that lower. <b>Titanium Powerbook - a.k.a. Tibook</b></p>\n<p>The Tibook has great efficiency. Mine runs at about 18 watts idle with the display dimmed, but still visible. I was surprised it was so low. What's nice is that you can also <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.mac.portables/browse_thread/thread/8d349929c86ff596/f75c0506ac817b5e%23f75c0506ac817b5e\">run the TiBook with the lid closed</a>, using an external display and peripherals. <b>Mac Mini Power</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304952\">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304952</a> - much better!<b>iMac Power Consumption</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.silentpcreview.com/article693-page1.html\">http://www.silentpcreview.com/article693-page1.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://weblog.infoworld.com/enterprisemac/archives/2006/02/imac_keeps_its.html\">http://weblog.infoworld.com/enterprisemac/archives/2006/02/imac<em>keeps</em>its.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.girr.org/mac_stuff/intel_imac_tips.html\">http://www.girr.org/mac<em>stuff/intel</em>imac_tips.html</a></p>\n<p>I just bought a iMac 17\" for my office - and I'm very glad I did. Its a fast machine and as you can see from the links above, very energy efficient.
