I run Apache on port 88 behind an NGINX proxy, so I've updated <tt>/usr/share/drupal6/scripts/cron.sh</tt> to use localhost:88. Hopefully that will fix the issue.</p>\n<p>Whenever I start using a new software package, I like to have a project with which to use it on. The project I'm using for Drupal6? Docunext!</p>\n<p>No, not replacing Movable Type, just setting up Drupal6 to publish even more information here.</p>\n<p>More notes about setting up Drupal6:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I dropped the default db, opting to setup a db prefix for all tables, selectively sharing the prefix for users, sessions, role, authmap, and sequences. I've done something similar with Mediawiki.</li>\n<li>I created /etc/drupal/6/sites/www.docunext.com for the above settings in settings.php</li>\n<li>I created /etc/drupal/6/sites/all/modules for shared modules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sites/all/modules idea was documented in /usr/share/drupal6/modules/README.txt:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"svxlb\"><pre>\nThis directory is reserved for core module files. Custom or contributed\nmodules should be placed in their own subdirectory of the sites/all/modules\ndirectory. For multisite installations, they can also be placed in a subdirectory\nunder /sites/{sitename}/modules/, where {sitename} is the name of your site\n(e.g., www.example.com). This will allow you to more easily update Drupal core files.\n<p>For more details, see: <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/176043\">http://drupal.org/node/176043</a></p>\n</pre></blockquote>\n<p>Still, I would prefer that folder not be in /etc. Actually, yeah, I don't want modules there. Instead, I removed the /usr/share/drupal6/sites symlink, created a folder in its place, then linked /etc/drupal/6/sites/www.docunext.com inside of it. I then moved the \"all\" folder from /etc/drupal/6/sites/all inside of it as well. The \"views\" module I'm trying is around 5mb alone, so I just don't want that clogging up my etckeeper repository!</p>\n<p>As for modules, I'm trying out the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Views</li>\n<li>Markdown / Tipogrify</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get Markdown / Tipogrify to work, I decompressed the files into /usr/share/drupal6/sites/all/modules (yay - consistently organized files!!), then navigated to Admin -> Site Building -> Modules and enabled the modules, then went to Admin -> Site configuration -> Input Formats, add input format. A little convoluted, but this system is very modular and extensible - I consider it a small price to pay.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Drupal6 Experiments and Implementation on Debian","date":"December 11th, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010/12/drupal6-experiments/"}}
