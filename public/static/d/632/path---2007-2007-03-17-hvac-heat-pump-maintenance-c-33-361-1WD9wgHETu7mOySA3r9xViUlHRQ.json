{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm going to call a heat pump specialist to inquire about maintenance and upkeep of the heat pump at my office. I would like the unit to be inspected as well. I installed an electronic, programmable thermostat and have done some research on heat pumps. I need to find the filter for replacement, too.</p>\n<p>My heat pump has an indoor and an outdoor component. I think the indoor component is where the filter is. Unfortunately, I haven't changed the filter in over a year and its supposed to be changed every month! Ouch. In addition to the filter in the heat pump, I also plan to add a filter at the inlet vent. It will be much easier to change on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://home.howstuffworks.com/how-to-troubleshoot-a-heat-pump1.htm\">How to troubleshoot a heatpump</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bge.com/portal/site/bge/menuitem.b7ea1209a7e6f21021b08424025166a0/\">Heatpump maintenance</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hannabery.com/hp101_2.shtml\">Heat Pumps 101</a></p>\n<p>Decent price for air filters:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.riteair.com/\">http://www.riteair.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/04/02/more-heat-pump-maintenance-info/\">More Heat Pump Maintenance Notes</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HVAC Heat Pump Maintenance"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-03-17-hvac-heat-pump-maintenance/"}}
