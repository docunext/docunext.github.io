{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I recently read up about Unicorn, a web server written in Ruby. The README file states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Unicorn is a HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels. Slow clients should only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both the the request and response in between Unicorn and slow clients.</blockquote>\n<p>This is a very clear and concise explanation of on example of how and when HTTP proxies might be used.</p>\n<p>Everything I've read about Unicorn has been well put, and since there is more to read - I'm on it! :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Unicorn and Buffering Proxy Servers","date":"November 20th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/11/unicorn-and-buffering-proxy-servers/"}}
