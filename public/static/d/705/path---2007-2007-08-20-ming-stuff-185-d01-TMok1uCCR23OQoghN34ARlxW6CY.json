If you are importing media elements, you may want to seriously consider importing them into the movie before outputting swf, it has been multiple times faster in my experience.</p>\n<p>Say for example, you have a flv movies, you may want to have ming build a swf with the flv reference hard coded (and rebuild it every time a user chooses a different movie to play) rather than having actionscript point the player to the new reference. </blockquote></p>\n<p>If you aren't familiar with <a href=\"http://ming.sourceforge.net/\">ming</a>, it is an amazing library which can be used to create swf movies, with bindings for PHP, perl, and more!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ming Stuff"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-08-20-ming-stuff/"}}
