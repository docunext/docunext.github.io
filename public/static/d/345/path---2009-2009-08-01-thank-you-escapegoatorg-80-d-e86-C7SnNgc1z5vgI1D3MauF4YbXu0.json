That didn't fix it, so I tried removing the ParseTree gem version 3.0.4, but now I'm getting an error saying it can't find the file merb-action-args. Doh!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Success, sorta. I found that running the merb.fcgi script manually did not produce any errors, so I decided to start it with <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Spawn-fcgi\">spawn-fcgi</a> and access it from <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/wiki/NGINX\">NGINX</a>. That worked fine, at least for the index. I don't have the paths setup correctly for the static files. But we're making progress. :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thank You EscapeGoat.org","date":"2009-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-08-01-thank-you-escapegoatorg/"}}
