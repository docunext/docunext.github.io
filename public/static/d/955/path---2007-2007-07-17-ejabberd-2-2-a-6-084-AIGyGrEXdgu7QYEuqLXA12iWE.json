{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The latest version of ejabberd in debian unstable is great! It simply works for me, even though I've had my share of frustrations with ejabberd in the past.</p>\n<p>Some notes to share:</p>\n<ul><li>I use a dedicated server for ejabberd because it can be pain to configure and maintain. I use a low-power device for it and let it be.</li><li>Along those lines, I set the server up with network security and use the built-in user database system for convenience. The new version of ejabberd works great with Adium and other jabber clients which support registering. The goal of our setup is convenience, and I think we've finally achieved it!</li><li>I do use the web server that is built in to ejabberd, it is useful for registering new users if necessary, as well as monitoring what's going on. <del>Since I use a dedicated server, I'm going to change the port to 80 from 5280.</del> I tried changing the port to 80 but it didn't work for some reason. No biggy.</li></ul>\n<p>Some links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/\">http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.adiumx.com/\">http://www.adiumx.com/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"eJabberd","date":"2007-07-17T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-17-ejabberd-2/"}}
