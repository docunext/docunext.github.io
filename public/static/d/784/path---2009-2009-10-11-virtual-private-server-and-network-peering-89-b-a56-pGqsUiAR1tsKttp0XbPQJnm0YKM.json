{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As far as I'm concerned, virtualization is the next quantum leap for computing.</p>\n<p>It will likely consume much of the remaining blocks of ipv4 addresses, but I have a suspicion that it will also help the adoption of ipv6.</p>\n<p>This post is titled: \"Virtual Private Server and Network Peering\" because I've been thinking about how \"tier 1\" networks share traffic with one another at no charge because they are presumably providing one another with the same or close to amount of bandwidth.</p>\n<p>How cool would it be to have relationships with a variety of independent vendors to \"peer\" (as a verb) network presence and redundancy.</p>\n<p>I could see a federated system like openid emerging to allow content producers and consumers that ability to systematically collaborate in a straightforward manner - almost like the meraki cloud management system.</p>\n<p>Virtualization wouldn't be the only component to something like this. It would also need to depend upon <a href=\"http://www.proxy-sys.com/\">proxy cache and redirection servers</a> to be any different than a routing system. Know what I'm talking about? Varnish!</p>\n<p>When I use the word federated, I mean distributed in a sane and synchronized manner. This type of network service / setup is becoming more popular, than say a strictly redundant configuration.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Virtual Private Server and Network Peering"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-10-11-virtual-private-server-and-network-peering/"}}
