On the flip side, there are also many focused PHP applications which only do a few things very well. The problem here is that the focused PHP applications do not integrate with each other well - within the interface, or the database.</p></p>\n<p>A potential solution to this problem is the integration of the focused PHP applications. There are some important questions to ask about this potential solution:</p><ol>    <li>Does the value of an integrated solution outweigh the cost?</li>    <li>Does the cost of an integrated solution outweigh the cost of an original creation? </li></ol><p>The second question there is complicated by the variables involved with an original creation:</p>\n<ul>    <li>Source code strategy (i.e. open source or closed source)</li>    <li>The risk of the original creation becoming another diluted, &quot;does many things, few things well&quot; group of applications</li></ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"PHP Applications","date":"2006-09-12T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/2006-09-12-php-applications-2/"}}
