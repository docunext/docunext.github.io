{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was getting DMA timeout errors on a FreeNAS server setup yesterday, so I \"forgot\" the drive, then removed it from the array, and today I've just swapped out the physical drive.</p>\n<p>Strange, but I can't format the new drive, so now I'm \"inserting\" it into the existing one drive RAID 1 array. Hmmm, something about unable to store metadata. I might have to start over. Isn't that why its good to have RAID 1 in the first place, so you don't have to start over?</p>\n<p>It appears that my SATA drives do not play well with power management, <strong><em>at all</em></strong>. Whenever I would try to format a drive, it would get kicked out and disappear entirely.</p>\n<p>Also turns out that I had to completely format the old RAID1 member before creating a new one, it kept on finding the old RAID and trying to set that one up. I think I've run into that problem before...</p>\n<p>Thanks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.vee.net/noise/2006/10/freebsd6-raid1.html\">http://web.vee.net/noise/2006/10/freebsd6-raid1.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gmirror\">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gmirror</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lantech.geekvenue.net/chucktips/jason/chuck/1175552464/index_html\">http://lantech.geekvenue.net/chucktips/jason/chuck/1175552464/index_html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"FreeNAS RAID Drive Swap","date":"May 7th, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-05-07-freenas-raid-drive-swap/"}}
