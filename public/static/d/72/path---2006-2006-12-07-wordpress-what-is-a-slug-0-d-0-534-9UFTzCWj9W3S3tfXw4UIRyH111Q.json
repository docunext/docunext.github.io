{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In Wordpress, there are a bunch of options to the right when you are drafting a blog entry. One of them is called the \"Post slug\". I've always wondered what this was, so I decided to test it out on this post. I think it is the URL entry for a permalink, based upon some information I found at <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts\">Wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Result: test failed! It makes sense though, to use permalinks in such a way that the page title can be used as a \"key\" for Wordpress to search the database for the entry requires mod_rewrite. Since I try not to use .htaccess files at all, and keep my Apache configuration files as simple and clean as possible, I'll go without. Oh well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is a slug This is a test"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/2006-12-07-wordpress-what-is-a-slug/"}}
