{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>What is Middleware?</h2>\n<p>Middleware, in the context of web frameworks, refers to processing components which reside between the end user and the web application. Depending upon the setup and configuration, middleware may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>catch errors</li>\n<li>alter the content</li>\n<li>track sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some web server standards like WSGI and WSAPI which support middleware, as well as some web application servers, like Ruby Rack.</p>\n<h2>What are Pipelines?</h2>\n<p>Pipelines is a term which is sometimes used to refer to XSL pipelines. XSL pipelines are a series of transformations which may or may not be applied to an XML document.</p>\n<p>As opposed to web server apis, XSL pipelines are quite simple to implement, though as far as I can tell, they are fairly uncommon. I've seen them used with Nexista, Cocoon, and NXINX.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Middleware versus Pipelines","date":"August 29th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-08-29-middleware-versus-pipelines/"}}
