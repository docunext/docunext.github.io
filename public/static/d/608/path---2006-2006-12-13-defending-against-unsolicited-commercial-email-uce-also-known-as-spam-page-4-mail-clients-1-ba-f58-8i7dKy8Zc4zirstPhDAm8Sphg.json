Each time you mark messages as spam, Thunderbird improves its filtering so you can spend more time reading the mail that matters.

Thunderbird will tell you when it thinks a message might be a scam.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Security</strong>    Thunderbird provides enterprise and government grade security features including S/MIME, digital signing, message encryption, support for certificates and security devices.
