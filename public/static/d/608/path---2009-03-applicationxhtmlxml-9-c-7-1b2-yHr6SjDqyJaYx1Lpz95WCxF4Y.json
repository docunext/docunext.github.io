{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>With XHTML, mime type really makes a difference, especially 1.1. At least in my experience it does.

Yay.</p>\n<p>In PHP, this can be done like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"php\">ini_set('default_mimetype','application/xhtml+xml');</pre>\n<p>I was trying to figure this out to use the nice <a href=\"http://shjs.sourceforge.net/doc/documentation.html\">shjs</a> package, but for some reason it wouldn't work without the right mime-type.</p>\n<p>Oh, but of course Microsoft Internet Explorer doesn't like this. Thankfully there is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#ie\">rough fix</a>, but I'll probably just have use a separate stylesheet to render the output as html instead of xml.
