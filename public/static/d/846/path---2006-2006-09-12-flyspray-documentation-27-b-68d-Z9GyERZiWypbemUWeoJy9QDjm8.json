It would hang, so I interrupted it. Seemed like it may have messed up my mysql tables a little, but so far the only error I get is:\n<pre>\nStopping MySQL database server: mysqld.\n\nStarting MySQL database server: mysqld.\n\nChecking for corrupt, not cleanly closed and upgrade needing tables..</pre>\n<p>After that, I started to manually configure it. This is where flyspray really impressed me, it has a guided setup which is very easy to follow. The debian installer omitted a few things (setup and sql), but other than that, it was a cakewalk.</p></p>\n<p>All in all, I was able to install flyspray in a half an hour.</p><h3 id=\"toc1\">Flyspray Operation</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flyspray Documentation","date":"September 12th, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2006/2006-09-12-flyspray-documentation/"}}
