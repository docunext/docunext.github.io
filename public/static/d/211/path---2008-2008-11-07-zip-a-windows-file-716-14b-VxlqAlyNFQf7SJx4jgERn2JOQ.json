{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm a mac user for the most part, so when I work on a windows machine some tasks that are routine for me vary ever so slightly, and I'm stumped for a moment on how to do them. Today's silly stumper was how to zip a file on my boyfriend's xp machine. It was really easy, but I had to find the right option.<ol>\t<li>Right click the file you want to compress</li>\t<li>Mouse over to the \"Send To\" option (it's another drop down menu)</li>\t<li>Select the first choice \"Compressed (zipped) Folder\"</li></ol></p>\n<p>And you're done it's that easy, provided you know where to look. The send to drop down was what confused me. I didn't look there at first because I didn't think it suited the action I was trying to complete. Just goes to show you check every menu if you don't see what you're looking for.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"zip a Window s file"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-11-07-zip-a-windows-file/"}}
