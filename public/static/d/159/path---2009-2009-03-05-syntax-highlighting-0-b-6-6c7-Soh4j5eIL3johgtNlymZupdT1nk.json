{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I use wp-syntax for syntax highlighting on Wordpress, but I changed the code to use:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_html\">\n&lt;pre class=\"sh_html\">\n&lt;/pre>\n</pre>\n<p>instead of:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh_html\">\n&lt;pre lang=\"html\">\n&lt;/pre>\n</pre>\n<p>I did this for future xhtml compliance. I also did it for <a href=\"http://shjs.sourceforge.net/doc/documentation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">shjs</a>, which uses class too. Ultimately I think that syntax highlighting should be a client side process, especially for code snibbets which are embedded in other markup. Complete files are much easier to send through a web server filter (like source-highlighter) for faster processing and cacheable content. Wordpress does some wacky internal formatting and filtering like changing quotes and such, and thankfully wp-syntax avoids all that, so I'm sticking with it for as long as I use Wordpress for rendering output.</p>\n<p>I would also like to use &#x3C;code> tags along with &#x3C;pre>, but that makes some of my transformations with XSL a little more difficult to use them together. I may end up switching to only using &#x3C;code> - in that case I'll have a lot of tags to change over!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Source Code Syntax Highlighting For Fun and Profit","date":"2009-03-05T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-03-05-syntax-highlighting/"}}
