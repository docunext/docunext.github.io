{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm not too familiar with Debian as an OS, but as far as the installation process is concerned, its great.  I've installed it onto a few machines now, and after a few installations its a breeze.  The majority of installation is self explanatory, although there are a few steps I was unsure of.

Aside from a few uncertainties I was able to get Debian up and running quickly and painlessly.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debian Installer"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008/2008-08-05-debian-installer-2/"}}
