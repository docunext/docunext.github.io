The drive inside is a real SCSI drive (SEAGATE ST39236LWV 0010), using an Adaptec PCI-X card in a 32-bit PCI slot (ahc0: &#x3C;Adaptec 29160 Ultra160 SCSI adapter> port 0xf400-0xf4ff mem 0xfbffa000-0xfbffafff irq 16 at device 13.0 on pci0). The machine is an AOpen XC-Cube. Unfortunately, this machine has a low-efficiency power supply, so at idle with only one hard drive, the system still consumes at least 57 watts. :-(</p>\n<p>I have to admit, I'm already thinking about using these devices as members of RAID sets! Since <a href=\"http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/freenas-on-a-asus-terminator-c3.html\">NFS doesn't work out of the box on FreeNSD (it does work, but you have to hack the config file)</a>, the iSCSI initiator makes it a really awesome solution.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when I try the same steps on an ASUS Terminator C3 running FreeNas - the entire process gets messed up. My guess is that the problems stem from the fact the machine is running a gigabit ethernet card in a PCI slot. However, I don't see how the AOpen device would do any better with the SCSI card in a PCI slot. There must be some heavy duty RAM caching going on I'm not aware of - as a buffer between the drive and the nic.</p>\n<pre>\nhdparm -tT /dev/sdb2/dev/sdb2:\nTiming cached reads:   1242 MB in  2.00 seconds = 621.23 MB/sec\nTiming buffered disk reads:   28 MB in  3.01 seconds =   9.30 MB/sec\n</pre>\n<p>Actually, believe it or not I just ran e2fsck on /dev/sdb2 and now its running fine. I was getting an IO error earlier, but the e2fsck fixed it. Sweet. So I guess you can run FreeNAS iSCSI on the ASUS Terminator C3 which is very cool. Just be aware that you'll want to put a gigabit card into a pci card slot, which will only give you 300Mbits of bandwidth, but apparently that is enough for the service to operate.</p>\n<p>Thanks to</p>\n<p><a title=\"ubuntu iscsi\" href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=236825&page=2\">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=236825&#x26;page=2</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"FreeNAS iSCSI","date":"2007-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-07-10-freenas-iscsi/"}}
