I don't think that's a very good idea, but maybe its helping them in the fight against fraud.</p>\n<p>The possible solution that I'm hoping will work is to use the limited cookie controls available in Iceweasel (Firefox) to cut down on the number of cookies that are saved, so that I can more easily manage them. When they get to be too many, I don't bother managing and cleaning them, and so the problem gets worse. Wish me luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Taking Cookies More Seriously"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-06-03-taking-cookies-more-seriously/"}}
