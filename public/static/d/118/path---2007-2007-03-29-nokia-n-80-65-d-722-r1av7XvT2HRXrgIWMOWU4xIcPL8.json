{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The nokia n800 is a beautiful and well designed machine. Some notable improvements over the 770 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>handlebar / stand built in</li>\n<li>faster</li>\n<li>support for two full sd cards</li>\n<li>longer battery life</li>\n<li>camera! (though the quality isn't too hot)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>nokia is definitely onto something with these internet tablets. It would be nice if they could make the screen just a little bit wider (1024!), and add a scroll wheel to scroll up and down, because the display is so short. Of course they should also add the ability to charge via USB!</p>\n<p>I installed osso-xterm and rhapsody today. :-) Rhapsody is very nice - is this an ipod killer? Seems to have a good music library even though I could not find 'the cuckoo' by donovan. :-(</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nokia n800","date":"2007-03-29T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-03-29-nokia-n80/"}}
