{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I can't believe I'm actually saying this, even after getting a nasty paper cut when opening my Windows XP Home OEM from Newegg.com yesterday, but Windows on a Mac is actually fun. I'm trying out the different emulators, even bought Parallels yesterday (<a href=\"http://mytechdeals.blogspot.com/2007/02/pc-connection-mac-deals.html\">check out the deal on Macs and Parallels at My Tech Deals</a>).</p>\n<p>So far I have a little myriad of operating systems up and running, and I cen see how this really is the best way to compute. It makes machine settings so much more portable and permanent, almost bridges the best of the network and desktop features together in one computing model. Super cool.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Windows is Fun on a Mac"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-02-17-windows-is-fun-on-a-mac/"}}
