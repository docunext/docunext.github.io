This will allow you to see backlinks to your site's pages. This information used to be public via the search engine, but was abused and thus not updated with full disclosure.</p>\n<p>Thanks again Google! :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Major Improvements to Google s Webmaster Tools"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/2007-04-03-major-improvements-to-googles-webmaster-tools/"}}
