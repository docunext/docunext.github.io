{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today I used jEdit to write scripts to run with Selenium.  In jEdit you basically write an html script telling Selenium what action to take and areas of the software to test.  Selenium follows these instructions by reading html that is put into tables.</p>\n<p><textarea rows=\"10\" cols=\"60\"><tr>\t<td>open</td>\t<td>/</td>\t<td></td></tr><tr>\t<td>type</td>\t<td>s</td>\t<td>music</td></tr><tr>\t<td>clickAndWait</td>\t<td>searchsubmit</td>\t<td></td></tr><tr>\t<td>clickAndWait</td>\t<td>link=Cruisin</td>\t<td></td></tr></textarea></a></p>\n<p>This is basically telling Selenium to open the page, type music in the search bar, click search, and then  click on the link entitled Cruisin.  I find that if im having trouble getting an action to work writing the HTML myself, I will actually perform the task using the IDE interface and then examine the html generated by the program.  Next I am going to use selenium to use the refresh and pause commands.</p>\n<p>I found this <a href=\"http://release.openqa.org/selenium-core/nightly/reference.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">guide</a> to be very useful in helping writing different functions for Selenium.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"jEdit In Conjunction with Selenium","date":"May 31st, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2007/05/jedit-in-conjunction-with-selenium/"}}
