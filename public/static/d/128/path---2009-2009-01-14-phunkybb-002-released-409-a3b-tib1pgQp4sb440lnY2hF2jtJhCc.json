{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I found myself making major changes to all the SQL queries in the Subversion trunk, and then remembered I hadn't yet branched the current version!

I tagged and branched <a href=\"http://www.phunkybb.com/trac/browser/branches/phunkybb-0.02\">phunkybb-0.02</a> from yesterday, so all is good. I'll keep maintaining that for bugs, but all new work will be done on the trunk. If 0.02 gets used by a bunch of people, I might copy over non-site_id improvements, but I'd rather focus on the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PhunkyBB 0.02 Released","date":"January 14th, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/2009-01-14-phunkybb-002-released/"}}
