I tried csync2 again tonight for simpler stuff than what I would use puppet for. Seems like there is a big bug with csync2 and ssl:

<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501289">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501289</a>

I'm just not using ssl for now:

<pre class="sh_sh">nossl * *;
group serverfarm{...}</pre>

Hopefully it gets fixed soon!

I had gotten it to work last year as described here: <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/03/csync2-on-debian.html">http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/03/csync2-on-debian.html</a>
