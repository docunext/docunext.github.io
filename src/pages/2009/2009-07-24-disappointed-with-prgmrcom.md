      Hi Luke, thanks for following up. I got your emails and responded from both my main account and a backup in case they are getting filtered for some reason.

      Once I get up and running with your service I'll definitely write up another review.

Its been over a week since I ordered and paid a first month's fee for a virtual xen server from prgmr.com and haven't heard anything since the initial response and receipt for my payment.

I have to say I'm quite disappointed. I had high expectations for them. Doh!

I'm going to give Fsck VPS a try. They have great prices on bandwidth.

UPDATE: Prgmr.com has resolved my issue by setting up my account. I've just logged in and everything appears to be in working order. In the few moments I've had to start using it, I can tell I'm going to like this service. Their network has really low latency and Xen is setup really well, I think their setup even includes the ability install custom kernels! :-)

After I get this vps up and doing what I need it to, I may consider ordering another one from prgmr.com.
