Today's WWDC came and went without any ground breaking news... I was seriously hoping that they would announce a new product.

I've been expecting some sort of tablet / e-book reader for awhile now, but nothing yet.

I guess the next big thing for Apple to launch for the Macintosh will be Snow Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6. Speaking of which, it sounds really amazing - especially OpenCL.
