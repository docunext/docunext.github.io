There have been quite a lot of posts on Planet Debian lately about the Debian port to GNU/kFreeBSD, mostly from <a href="http://slackydeb.blogspot.com/">slackydeb</a>.

This is a project I'm very excited about! <a href="http://www.docunext.com//kFreeBSD">I've tested Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a> a bunch, but haven't been able to contribute much besides that.

Thanks to the slackydeb posts which specifically request help with busybox, I might be able to lend a hand if I can find some time over the next few weeks. If I'm too late to help with busybox, I'm sure there will be other tasks to focus on.
