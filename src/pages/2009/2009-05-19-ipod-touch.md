      I think its even possible to use the ipod touch as a phone using VOIP over wifi.

      really!! that's incredible. you would need the microphone attachment for the ipod touch.<br/><br/>That's pretty funny if the ipod touch can totally circumvent the whole phone plan business simply by using VOIP.

I didn't even know they had come out with these until about a week ago. My clinical partner was using hers to search reference material. That's how the fascination began. I've been dying for apple to come out with a PDA for many years now. the iphone was close, but I'm not about to pay for a monthly plan on the device.

The ipod touch is everything I could want in a PDA. It's flexible to the programs that I put on it. I can keep my schedule, and appointment book on it, and sync it to my computer, so I don't lose any info.

Surprisingly the ability to play mp3's on the device is the least exciting thing about it for me. I'm leaning towards the 16gb one just so I can load it up with music and apps. I'm still not quite ready to make the purchase. Not sure if I'm still under the allure of new toy syndrome or not. I may just be mezmorized by the new technology (new to me - I'm slow). The fact that it has an accelerometer in it boggles my mind. The parts must be so tiny.
