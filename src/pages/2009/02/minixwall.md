This is a cool idea - its a port of the linux netfilter software to the minix operating system. Minix could be a quality operating system for routers and firewalls, but if I understand correctly it still needs some work before its ready.

Since the author released his thesis under the GPL, I've mirrored it in HTML <a href="http://www.docunext.com/archives/minixwall/index/">here</a>.
