I finally got around to trying out the tesseract optical character recognition software. It works way better than any other OCR software I've used, and I've used quite a bit.

There are debian packages for both tesseract and leptonica, but I wanted to try out Ocropus too because it has page layout capabilities. And so I had to download and install a few items, thankfully, <a href="http://www.nubae.com/ocropus---the-next-gen-linux-ocr-software-1">this page</a> supplied all the information I needed.
