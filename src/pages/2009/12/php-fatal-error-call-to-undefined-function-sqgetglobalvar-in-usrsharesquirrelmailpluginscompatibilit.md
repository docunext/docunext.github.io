Just fixed a SquirrelMail installation. I guess the latest SquirrelMail update on Debian caused some conflicts between the courier_vacation plugin and the compatibility plugin.

I edited the courier vacation options file:

<pre class="sh_php">
/*
   if (defined('SM_PATH'))
      include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/compatibility/functions.php');
   else if (file_exists('../plugins/compatibility/functions.php'))
      include_once('../plugins/compatibility/functions.php');
   else if (file_exists('./plugins/compatibility/functions.php'))
      include_once('./plugins/compatibility/functions.php');
*/
//   if (compatibility_check_sm_version(1, 3))
   if (1==2)
   {
      include_once (SM_PATH . 'include/validate.php');
      include_once (SM_PATH . 'functions/page_header.php');
      include_once (SM_PATH . 'include/load_prefs.php');
      include_once (SM_PATH . 'plugins/courier_vacation/config.php');
   }
   else
   {
      include_once ('../include/validate.php');
      include_once ('../functions/page_header.php');
      include_once ('../include/load_prefs.php');
      include_once ('../plugins/courier_vacation/config.php');
   }
</pre>

On my debian machine, the file is located here:

/usr/share/squirrelmail/plugins/courier_vacation/options.php

SquirrelMail isn't a perfect webmail system, but its the one that I use. And the courier vacation plugin is actually pretty good, as well as the change password plugin.

Now that I think of it, I'm going to setup some Git repositories of SquirrelMail.
