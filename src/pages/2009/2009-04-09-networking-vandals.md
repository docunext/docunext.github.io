What is up with people cutting network cables? AT&amp;T had major communications problems due to two of their fiber optics cables being cut, apparently by vandals.

This is not a small issue. All communications were down for AT&amp;T - land line telephones and mobile phone services. Why in the world would someone want to prevent people from communicating?

I have to imagine that it was a sophisticated, coordinated effort, as multiple lines were reportedly cut. I imagine that the criminals must have known that they were cutting AT&amp;T wires, the probability that both cables were inadvertently AT&amp;T's network is highly unlikely.
