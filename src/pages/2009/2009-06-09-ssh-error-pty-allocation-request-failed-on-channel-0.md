      Hi,<br/>example.com is the virtual machine hostname where you could no log in? So, you have to modify the /etc/fstab of your VM?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/> M

      Yes - example.com is the machine I was having trouble logging into, and the second command is issued on that machine.

Whoops! After cleaning up some virtual machines, I went too aggressive on some normal machines and removed some necessary stuff. I think I'll be able to fix this though, as I'm still able to issue commands via ssh.

I reinstalled and re-enabled udev but I was still having problems, so I did this:

<pre>
ssh example.com "sudo bash -i"

echo "none /dev/pts devpts defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

mount -a</pre>

Then I was able to login again.
