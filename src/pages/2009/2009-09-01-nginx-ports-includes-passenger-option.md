      Haven't been able to get this working yet. I'm not sure if the build worked properly. I thought I might need to install passenger separately, but that seemed to try and install <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Apache">Apache</a>.

Nice! I've been meaning to try out the NGINX Passenger module, as well as NGINX on FreeBSD. Well, tonight I finally got around to trying out the latter, only to pleasantly discover there is an option for building the Passenger module as well.

Good thing I scrolled down!! :-)

<pre class="sh_sh">[alert]: Phusion Passenger is disabled because the 'passenger_root' option is not set. Please set this option if you want to enable Phusion Passenger.</pre>
Next step: activate passenger! And a question - do I have to use RoR? I'd prefer Sinatra... or plain eRuby.
