The latest version of Google Chrome for linux breaks an important component on my machine: drop-down select menus appear blank.

The top, current selection changes when I use the arrow keys, thankfully, because otherwise there is no way to know which option the mouse selects.

While this bug doesn't completely prevent the use of Chrome, I've temporarily switched back to using Iceweasel 3.5.

UPDATE: Approximately one week later, this has been fixed. A big thanks to the Chrome team!
