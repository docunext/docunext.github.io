Headlines today are reporting on the Pystar versus Apple lawsuit and the tone doesn't bode well for Pystar.

Will Apple ever allow clones again? I'd be surprised if they didn't, as I really think that more people would be willing to try a non-Microsoft operating system now more than anytime in quite some years, if forever.

Apparently people want to run Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware enough that they are hacking the software to do it, so much that Apple is stuck playing cat-and-mouse with them!
