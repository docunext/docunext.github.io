With the announcement of its revamped iphone GS3 Apple has lowered the cost of the current 8G iphone to only $99. The new GS3 sports a faster processor,&nbsp; a compass, a video camera and a photo camera with better resolution and auto-focus.

Apple also announced they would be dropping the price on some of their MacBooks by $300. That's pretty significant considering Apple hardware rarely goes on sale unless a new era of technology is heralding out the old era.
