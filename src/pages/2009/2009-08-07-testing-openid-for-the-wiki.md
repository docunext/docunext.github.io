I've enabled OpenID for the <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/">Docunext Wiki</a>. If you have something to add, feel free to login.<div>
</div><div>If there is an onslaught of spam comments, I'll close it up. However, I've been using <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Mod_spamhaus">mod_spamhaus</a>, so there shouldn't be a problem.</div>
