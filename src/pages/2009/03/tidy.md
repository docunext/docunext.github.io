Tidy is a nice little library which is used to to clean up HTML. Its been around for awhile, and from what I understand, it has been retained and maintained by a group of users after the original author, Dave Raggett, decided to halt upkeep.

There are many language bindings, and I've recently been using a lot more for converting HTML into valid <a href="http://www.docunext.com/">XML</a>, which can be transformed by <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> into XHTML. Good stuff!
