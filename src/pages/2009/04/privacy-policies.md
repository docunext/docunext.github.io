I finally got around to creating some privacy policies for the websites my company publishes. Here's an example:

<a href="http://www.docunext.com/:Privacy_policy">Docunext Tech Stuff Privacy Policy</a>

I was surprised at how complicated the process was. In addition to the human readable privacy policy, I also created an <a href="http://www.docunext.com/w3c/p3p.xml">XML file p3p.xml</a> as well as an <a href="http://www.docunext.com/w3c/privacy_policy.xml">XML version of the privacy policy</a>.
