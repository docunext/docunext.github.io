This is not a new discovery to me, I've known that pfSense is an amazing resource. I'm posting this to make sure that other people know this as well.

I've been using pfSense for about 3 years now, and I use it everyday. It is part of my company's infrastructure, as firewalls, IPSec VPN gateways, a DHCP server, and a NAT tool.

If you have considered using pfSense but haven't gotten around to it yet, take my positive experience into consideration. You might like it as much as I do!
