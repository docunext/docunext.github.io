      Why aren't I using Linux?  Because I'm using FreeBSD :)

I'll admit, it took me awhile to use linux as my "desktop" computer, but I've been proudly been using linux for well over 5 years. That's not even that long of a time - I wish I started much sooner!

And because hind sight is 20/20, I'll ask the Docunext readers - why aren't you using linux? If you need a little help, just try a live CD from Ubuntu! It will let you try it out without needing to install anything. And if you have an extra computer or laptop lying around that you aren't using, why not install it on that?

You can find an Ubuntu Live CD here:
