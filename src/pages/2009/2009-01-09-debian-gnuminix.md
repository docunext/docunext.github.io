The **Debian GNU/Minix** project seems to actually exist, except mostly obscure. It appears to have been mentioned on the <a href="http://www.braincells.com/debian/index.cgi/search/item=126" rel="nofollow">Lasalle Blog in 2006</a>, and its also mentioned on a newer page of the Debian Wiki:

<a href=" http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/Minix">http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/Minix</a>

Why Debian GNU/Minix? Minix is a very small, reliable kernel, making it appropriate for embedded systems, of which I am a huge fan!
