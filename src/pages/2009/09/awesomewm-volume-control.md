The one thing I miss in the awesomewm is convenient volume control.

I've tried a few widgets for volume control, but none have worked for me yet. I also tried the gnome volume applet hoping it would join in with the gnome-power-applet and nm-applet, but no luck.

So I continue to have to open gnome-volume-control to simply mute / unmute my audio. I wish the fn-keys worked.... that would certainly make things easier.
