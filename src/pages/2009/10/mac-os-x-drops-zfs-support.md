I just learned that Mac OS X has dropped support for ZFS, the file system from OpenSolaris.

That is surprising, and slightly disappointing to me. I was pleased to learn about ZFS and some of its unique capabilities when it was released under an open source license. Based on my interest, I tried out Nexenta and that seemed pretty cool.

When I heard it was ported to FreeBSD and Mac OS X, I was even more pleased.

Who knows why Apple has dropped their interest in ZFS. It might have nothing to do with the file system itself.
