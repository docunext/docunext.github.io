Chrome, the browser from Google, continues to rock my world. Its insanely fast and "just works".

Kudos to the entire development team.

Two minor complaints / feature requests:

* Can I see more of the URL in the area where the status bar when rolling over a link? It only shows about the first 60 or so characters. Why?
* Printing to a file doesn't work for me - it crashes, but its not Chrome's fault, my system is mis-configured. Iceweasel does the same thing.

Also of note, I'm also using the all_proxy and no_proxy environment variables and they work fine.
