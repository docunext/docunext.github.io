I'm a big fan of [markdown](http://www.docunext.com/) syntax. I'm using it right now as I write this post via Movable Type Open Source, I use it with [ikiwiki](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Ikiwiki), and believe it or not, I also use it when writing letters and business documents. [Markdown2pdf](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Pandoc) makes it even better.

However I do have one problem. There is a clash between the file naming convention I'm used to and the way italics is activated within Markdown.

<div>I really wish that the author had chosen something like the tilda (~) instead of the underscore (_)!</div>

I've written before about [the importance of hyphens and underscores to programmers](http://www.docunext.com/2009/07/trends-in-technical-syntax-hyphens-and-underscores/). In an obscure way, this is similar to the situation with ampersands (&) and XML.

I never understood why the ampersand was chosen as an entity token. Perhaps the writers of the specification didn't know how incredibly common a punctuation mark it is.

Like the ampersand in XML, I'm under the impression that its not a trivial task to globally alter the syntax parser of Markdown. Maybe its time to consider an alternative?
