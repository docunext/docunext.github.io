I'm looking at some options to order a xen vps in Europe.

These are some of the options I'm reviewing:

* [Xencon](http://www.xencon.net/512_2)
* [RapidXen in Frankfurt](http://rapidxen.net/europlans.php)
* [XenPlanet in the Ireland](http://www.xenplanet.com/service.php)
* [Goscomb Technologies in London](http://www.goscomb.net/services/vps.php) Cool! They natively support IPv6!

I've tried out VPS Ville which offers services in the UK, but they only offer OpenVZ, not Xen.

I love OpenVZ when I'm managing it.
