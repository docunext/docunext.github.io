Wow! The Network Manager software package got way better recently!

A little background - Network Manager is an graphical user interface
open source network management application which can help users connect
in a variety of ways:

<ul><li>Wired</li><li>Wireless</li><li>Virtual Private Networks</li><li>Mobile Broadband</li></ul>
I'd previously used Network Manager and the nm-applet tool to connect
to some open wireless networks, but initially had to manually edit the
wpa_supplicant.conf file for WPA secure wireless networks. Eventually I
was able to manage WPA networks with nm-applet, but it took some time
to get there.

Just recently, nm-applet got an upgrade which in my experience is
working *really* well. I'm using it to connect to a variety of
networks, and everything goes super smooth. I'm very excited about the
mobile broadband connectivity - what a surprise! I'm connected with it
as I type this. You know it: <b>vzw3g</b> rocks! :-)

I'm also very interested in the VPN connectivity. I've previously used
such a setup with Mac OS X, but never on GNU/Linux. I've manually
configured IPSec on GNU/Linux to connect to a pfSense IPSec machine on
the other end, but in those instances both systems had multiple
interfaces, and public and private address space.

That's all besides the point though, the "Add" VPN configuration is disabled for me. :-(
