The one thing I find seriously lacking with Lua is the limited amount of libraries. However, there are some really good ones.

For example:

* [JSON4Lua](http://json.luaforge.net/)
* [Lua Discount](http://asbradbury.org/projects/lua-discount/)
* [Lua Tinycdb](http://asbradbury.org/projects/lua-tinycdb/)
* [Lua Curl](http://luaforge.net/projects/luacurl/)
* [Lua LDAP](http://www.keplerproject.org/lualdap/)
* [Lua Memcached](http://luamemcached.luaforge.net/)

I'm curious about [Lua Rings](http://keplerproject.github.com/rings/index.html) but I can't quite figure it out.

Certainly one of the more useful libraries is the **file system library**. That should make it very useful for shell scripting.

And yes! There is an interface to Toyko Tyrant!!

* [Lua-tokyotyrant](http://github.com/audrencezar/lua-tokyotyrant) (All your database are belong to Mikio.)

In fact, it looks like [Lua is even integrated into Tokyo Tyrant](http://1978th.net/tokyotyrant/spex.html#luaext)!
