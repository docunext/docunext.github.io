**Cloud computing** is one of the hyped up concepts of recent years which I'm really getting into, and even wasn't too much of a skeptic when it first emerged.

Why? Not sure... but does it matter? I only mention that because its my way of saying that I believe cloud computing to be quite a legitimate theory. I even find that [cloud computing to have cultural significance](http://www.albertlash.com/blog/2010/04/the-cultural-significance-of-the-cloud.html)!

Many companies have and are investing in "**cloud infrastructure**", including **Amazon**. They have many cloud computing products and services, and the primarily one I'm using these days is called **Cloud Front**. Its a *content distribution network* that uses Amazon's S3 service as the back-end.

I'm only using it minimally though - I have my own content distribution network which I prefer for most situation.

For the technical details on my setup, check out the Docunext page on [Amazon's S3](http://www.docunext.com/3) and [Cloud Front services](http://www.docunext.com/wiki/Cloud_Front).
