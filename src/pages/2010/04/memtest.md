      Swapping the memory may not do it.<br/><br/>I had similar problems, and ran memcheck for 24 hours.  No errors found.  So I swapped the ram.  Same problem.  Turned out it was the motherboard.<br/><br/>So if swapping the ram doesn't cure it, look to the motherboard.<br/>

I hadn't run memtest in ages, but I did so yesterday:


The test did not find any errors with the RAM, but I still replaced it as the machine was having occasional machine check exceptions.
