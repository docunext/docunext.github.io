      <a href="http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Media Player Classic</a>...fantastic player for Windows...can handle a DVD ISO and/or files in a directory, plays nearly any format.<br/><br/>I still prefer VLC most of the time, but it can't do DVDs well.

      Thanks Andrew! I will check this out. I gave up last night after MPlayer started crashing and ended up attaching my portable DVD player to my television. Worked like a charm but not a convenient option. I'll try Media Player Classic today, looks perfect!

      What I love about VLC is that I never need to worry about codec support. I remember when I used to have to search high and low to find codecs for obscure media formats or have to switch between different media players, but VLC really makes things easy.

Based on my personal preferences, I use Microsoft Windows as little as possible.

Due to the fact that Netflix is cheaper than cable where I live, I use Netflix. I personally find it inconvenient that it only supports Microsoft Internet Explorer, but that is besides the point. Fact is that I use Windows to watch television.

Previously I've used Windows Media Player, but today there is a time lapse between the video and the audio. In my opinion, that is unacceptable.

I'm looking at alternatives:

* VLC
* MPlayer

**VLC**

Audio is not working for me for some reason.

**MPlayer**

Everything I try causes it to crash.
