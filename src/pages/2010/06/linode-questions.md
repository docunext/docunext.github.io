I am planning on adding another linode. Two questions:

* How do I select a different data center? Its asking me to pay, whereupon I'm expect that my linode will be provisioned. Can they be relocated?
* Can I share IPs across linodes in different data centers?

I've just submitted these questions as a support request.

Very quick response! I choose after payment, and IPs cannot be shared across data centers. My follow-up:

"No problem about the ip addresses between data centers, just curious because of the statement regarding failover ips."
