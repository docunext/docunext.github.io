I was doing some research on Ruby garbage collection (GC) and found this post about Ruby 1.9.2:

[Incredibly impressed with 1.9.2](http://fukamachi.org/wp/2009/12/04/incredibly-impressed-with-ruby-1-9-2/)

<blockquote>
Performance is up around 20% on 1.9.1, too.
</blockquote>

I'm fairly locked into place with 1.9.1 for now, but it will be awesome to install 1.9.2 when I'm ready!
