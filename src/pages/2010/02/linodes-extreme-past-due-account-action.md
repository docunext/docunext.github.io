      Hello -<br/><br/>Suspending a Linode is the last thing we want to do, especially to a long-standing customer.  We do send several notices via e-mail before suspending an account.  Please open or update your support ticket and we will make sure you received them.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Thomas Asaro<br/>Linode, LLC

      Are you sure their emails didn't get caught in a spam filter or something? They usually send out multiple emails, and give you 10 days before taking action, but if your spamfilter's catching their emails or something there's nothing they can do...

      I paid my past due balance, and so its all resolved now. Still, I think they should give someone who's been a good paying customer for over a year more of a grace period than 10 days.<br/><br/>Even Comcast, whose customer service I find abysmal, gives customers more than 60 days grace past due.<br/><br/>I'd even pay a late fee to avoid getting shut down!

I found out my account with Linode was past due today. How did I notice? The services I have setup on the virtual server I rent from them were unavailable. I logged into the web administration at linode.com and found my account was past due approximately $30.

Shutting down the service is a bit extreme in my opinion. I sent them this feedback:

<blockquote>"Hello, I only discovered my account was past due by my virtual server getting turned off last night. Please make an extra effort to contact me to alert me to the past due issue prior to shutting down the service. That is way too extreme in my opinion. I've been a customer for quite some time and am pretty offended you went to such measures. Please do not do this again."</blockquote>

The account was past due because my credit card on file expired. The same credit card is also used with an account I maintain at Slicehost. Thankfully they sent me several emails to let me know of the issue before shutting down my account!

In all other respects, my experience with Linode has been great.
