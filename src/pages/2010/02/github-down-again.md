Whoa - this is kind of odd. I was just perusing recent blog posts I made, saw the one about [Github being down](http://www.docunext.com/2010/02/github-down.html), and remembered I wanted to do some software development. I went to visit Github.com and found it to be down again! Eerie.

I'm not complaining too much about Github's service though. Although I pay them for some private repositories, its still a rocking cool service, and git itself makes it possible to stay somewhat productive during temporary outages.

UPDATE: By the time I finished this post, github was back up. Nice!
