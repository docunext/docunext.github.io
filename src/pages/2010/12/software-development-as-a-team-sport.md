title: Software Development as a Team Sport

I love developing software. Its a passion. I engage without much encouragement or convincing, and as such, often pursue my vocation on my own. I've previously written about [these](http://www.docunext.com/2008/05/playing-nicely-and-benefitting-without-belonging.html) [factors](http://www.docunext.com/2008/04/the-people-who-live-on-planet-debian.html).

Nowadays my work has taken me to a situation where software development simply has to be a team sport.

These days I'm working on projects that are scheduled to be completed in less time than a single individual has available. The only solution is to have multiple people, a team, working on the projects.

Unfortunately, our team does not have enough team members yet, and not surprisingly, our team is getting crabby and defensive.

Dear **lazyweb**, what advice might you offer?
