One of my clients is experiencing [performance issues with Outlook accessing Google's IMAP service](http://www.docunext.com/2010/12/review-of-google-apps-for-business-aka-gmail-imap.html).

To fix this situation, I'm planning to use remote assistance to control their PC and make the necessary configuration changes.

**UPDATE**: Despite my best efforts, I just could not get "Remote Assistance" to work. Shucks. Perhaps I should have simply tried GoToMyPC or something similar.

**UPDATE 2**: I am using Remote Desktop at my new place of employment regularly and it works quite well, but I still prefer VNC.
