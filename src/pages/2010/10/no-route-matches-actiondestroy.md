My recent post about [whether or not to use scaffolding](http://www.docunext.com/2010/10/just-say-no-to-scaffolding.html) has come home to roost!

*This only has to do with generating a controller, but it embodies some of my opinions of automatically generating code.*

Well, *sort of*. The subject of this post: **No route matches {:action=>"destroy"** refers to a rails 3 error that apparently involves the treatment of singular and plural references. I've come across the treatment of singular and plural nomenclature via DataMapper, but it was simpler to comprehend because I was actively modeling my data structures.

By generating a controller and views with rails 3, the objects felt more distant, and I don't like that. To me it seems like remote control sculpture! I like to **feel** what I'm working on. Know what I mean?

In a nutshell, I don't like to automatically generate code, but I'm warming up to the idea. I'm a huge fan of task automation, which is how I learned to stop worrying and love the command line.
