      Hi forumworx, I use the mini-box.com picoPSU, its a 120 watt power supply, but to use it with the dg965ss, I have to connect a hard drive connector to the motherboard via an adapter, which I bought from centrix-intl.com.<br/><br/>I'm now using the celeron 420 on this board - works great!

      So the picoPSU has only motherboard power connector, no peripheral connectors?<br/><br/>I'm looking at setting up one of these but I need a HD connector (sata or IDE).<br/><br/>Do other picoPSU's come with HD adapter? From all the pics I see on the web they are just a mobo connector. Thanks

      Nope, it has two regular 5/12 v molex power adapters like you'd find with a regular power supply. For a SATA HD, you'd need an adapter but that's no big deal. It also has a floppy adapter. I use one of the HD power connectors to go back to the mobo, and one to connect to a hard drive.

      - Any idea on power consumption vs. the Intel D201GLY?<br/><br/>- How about performance vs. the Intel D201GLY?<br/><br/>- Can you give some details on the CPU,<br/><br/>ie. Intel Celeron M 420 1.6 GHz 533 1MB 478 CPU SL8VZ.<br/><br/>- What about a heat sink? Are you using passive or with fan?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance

      Never mind the processor details...<br/><br/>Intel® Celeron® Processor 400 Sequence<br/>Processor Number 	Processor Speed 	System Bus Frequency 	L2 Cache Size 	BIOS Version<br/><br/>440	2 GHz 	          800 MHz 	512 KB 	1687 or greater<br/>430 	1.80 GHz 	800 MHz 	512 KB 	1687 or greater<br/>420 	1.60 GHz 	800 MHz 	512 KB 	1687 or greater<br/><br/>But the rest of the info would be good.<br/><br/>I need a low power system that will pull down torrents 24/7.<br/><br/>Which approach do you recoomend?<br/><br/>I can get the Intel D201GLY for $66, plus Power supply for $54... I have the rest of the components...<br/><br/>Thanks

      Also, this may seem like a dumb question but I'll ask anyway.<br/><br/>If I use a regular ATX power supply I have lying around. Say a 300W, the only extra energy consumption I could see is running the fan within the PSU vs. using the picoPSU.<br/><br/>Would that be the case?<br/><br/>$54 for a picoPSU, when I could use any PSU would save me some $$$.<br/><br/>Thanks, I asked alot of questions, hopefully they'll help others too.

      Hi Forumworx, the dg965ss uses a significant amount of more energy than the D201GLY, at least 45 watts, compared to the 25 watts on the D201GLY.<br/><br/>Those prices seem pretty high, especially for the picoPSU, you should be able to find it cheaper, though maybe you are including shipping costs. The D201GLY includes the processor, which makes is a total bargain, but if you need more that 1 PCI slot or 1GB or RAM, its not the right board.<br/><br/>The power supply is actually very important in determining the power consumption. I've tested some power supplies that add an additional 20 watts to a system.<br/><br/>These days since I'm running so many computers, I prefer to have fewer 120V to 12V transformers, and only use power supplies like the picoPSU when I need 5v.<br/><br/>You might also want to check out the ALIX board:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/alix/" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/alix.html</a><br/><br/>What is your application?

      Currently my 450W PSU with P4 2.8 with 4 HD's runs 24/7 for torrents.<br/><br/>I'd hate to calculate the power consumption on that bloat.<br/><br/>So I'm looking for a dedicated torrent machine, I looked at the Linksys NSLU2, but I dont have time for modding and then I'd need to purchase USB drive cases.<br/><br/>So I'll be happy with a low power dedicated torrent system that can serve up files to my HTPC when needed.<br/><br/>The Intel D201GLY seems ideal.<br/><br/>I'm in Canada, where is the cheapest place for the picoPSU? Where do you get yours?<br/><br/>Also, If I want to throw in a higher end Graphics card later, would the power supply handle it?<br/><br/>Thanks

      In that case I would definitely go with the D201GLY. The onboard graphics chip isn't bad, but the board doesn't have PCI-Express or AGP so you'd be better off with the onboard chip than a pci video card, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Also check into what bandwidth you'd need between the torrent server and the htpc, 100mbit should do it, but I'd be curious as to what you find.<br/><br/>For the picoPSU, check mini-box, idotpc, logicsupply.

      Thanks for the replies.<br/><br/>I noticed in your ALIX thread that you preferred the PW-200-M for the D201GLY.<br/><br/>It's actually cheaper than the picoPSU.<br/><br/>What you think is best?

      Good point! From now on I only use the PW-200-M for the D201GLY - the picoPSU won't fit on it without an extension. It might be a little bit less efficient but the difference is negligible. Remember, to use either of these power supplies, I also had to buy a 120V to 12V adapter - which is maybe why the price you mentioned earlier seemed high, you included the price of the power adapter...?

      Thanks,<br/><br/>In the ALIX thread you mentioned you liked the PW-200M for the D201GLY?<br/><br/>Should I go picoPSU or PW-200M. I don't see more than 1 HD, but I could see adding a PCI card.<br/><br/>Thanks

      You can decide, I haven't noticed much of a different between any of the ones I've used. Check the power capacity though, some don't provide enough. But with the D201GLY you should be OK with most of them out there.

My new intel DG965SS board arrived today and I was able to get it running the native graphics driver pretty quickly. Couple of tricks:


<b>Video on the DG965SS</b>
<ul><li>Don't use IDE, while possible, its funky (I went with a USB CDR and a SATA drive)</li><li>For i810 you'll need a more recent kernel. I'm using 2.6.22-1-686.</li><li>"modprobe i915"</li><li>My xorg.conf:
</li></ul>
<pre class="sh_sh">Section "Device"
        Identifier "intel"
        Driver "i810"
        Option "UseFBDev" "true"
        Option "VBERestore" "true"
        VideoRam 65536
EndSection</pre>

You can absolutely add more options but this works for me.

If you get the:

<pre class="sh_sh">(EE) GARTInit: Unable to open /dev/agpgart (No such file or directory) </pre>

Then you need to upgrade your kernel.

<b>Power Management on the DG965SS</b>

I was able to get the DG965SS to sleep and resume with no problem using s2ram -f -p, though I could not get it to resume via WOL. I was able to WOL from S5, or "off" mode.

With a relatively efficient power supply the system uses approximately 75 watts, though I think with a better processor it would consume much less, allowing it to possibly use a more efficient power supply.
<b>S3 Mode Wake on Lan</b>

Wake on lan from S3 "suspend to ram" should definitely be possible, as seen here in a screenshot from the intel manual on the DG965SS:


I'm guessing that for some reason the BIOS aren't telling debian GNU/linux that its possible, and acpitool isn't offering it as an option. Hmmmm.

More investigations:

<pre class="sh_sh">

20. AZAL        S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1b.0
</pre>

WTF is AZAL? How do I add ILAN to the S3 list? DSDT!!! But debian doesn't support custom DSDTs.... ugh.

Strange, in the DSDT ILAN is listed here along with EHCI, which appears in the S3 list:

<pre class="sh_sh">        Method (_L0D, 0, NotSerialized)        {            Notify (\_SB.PCI0.EHCI, 0x02)            Notify (\_SB.PCI0.EHC2, 0x02)            Notify (\_SB.PCI0.AZAL, 0x02)            Notify (\_SB.PCI0.ILAN, 0x02)        }</pre>

OK, here in the device sections, there is a section for ILAN and AZAL:

<pre class="sh_sh">Device (ILAN)
{
        Name (_ADR, 0x00190000)
        Name (PPS1, Package (0x02)
{
        0x0D,
        0x04
})
Method (_PRW, 0, NotSerialized)
{
        Return (PPS1)
}
}
</pre>

<pre class="sh_sh">Device (AZAL)
{
        Name (_ADR, 0x001B0000)
        Name (UPS1, Package (0x02)
                {                    0x0D,                    0x03                })
Method (_PRW, 0, NotSerialized)                {                    Return (UPS1)                }                OperationRegion (AZPM, PCI_Config, 0x55, 0x01)                Field (AZPM, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)                {                    AZWE,   1                }                Method (_PSW, 1, NotSerialized)                {                    If (LEqual (Arg0, Zero))                    {                        Store (0x00, AZWE)                    }                    If (LEqual (Arg0, One))                    {                        Store (0x01, AZWE)                    }                }
}</pre>

Notice how ILAN has 0x04 and AZAL has 0x03. I wonder if I simply changed the 0x04 to 0x03.

But how to get custom DSDT support in debian? I decided to simply use the ubuntu kernel, and then rebooted - guess what, it worked! Ha.  With s2ram -f -p, graphics even work. Pretty cool. In S3 mode the computer uses 3 watts of power. <strong>The amount of time it takes to wakeup? 5 seconds</strong>. Awesome!

For some reason, the ubuntu kernel stopped working and even a reinstall wouldn't fix it. I installed the low-latency kernel and that works again. I'm interested in what the low-latency optimizations are all about.

Other issues: * I couldn't get the server to boot off of USB. * Sound: no luck yet for audio input, trying to use:

<pre class="sh_sh"># /dev/dsp (Also loads snd_mixer_oss for /dev/mixer)
modprobe snd_pcm_oss
# /dev/midi
modprobe snd_seq_oss</pre>

Err, guess that wasn't necessary. I just switched to a newer kernel and it works fine!
