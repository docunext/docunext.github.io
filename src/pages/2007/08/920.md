      You *really* shouldn't use 1.0.1 anymore. We've been recommending for months that people use the most recent 1.2 RC for all new installs.

      Hi Chris - thanks so much for the heads up. I'm still new to pfSense even though I've been using m0n0wall for awhile.

      No problem.<br/><br/>I recommend keeping an eye on pfsense.blogspot.com, we post a lot of info on changes, recommendations, features, new releases, etc. there. Including this recommendation a few months back.

      Cool, the more I read about pfSense, the more I like it, but it has been difficult for me to get my mind around it because the website(s) are a little all over the place, and when I saw a statement about how the m0n0wall docs should be used as a reference to pfsense, I guess I just latched onto that.

      Wow, I'm trying out pfsense 1.2 and it a major improvement. The interface is no longer so busy, and it seems to be more stable all over. GREAT WORK!

Just got this error on the console of a WRAP powered pfsense firewall. I'm trying to set it up to use a wireless interface as the WAN port.

<pre>*** Welcome to pfSense 1.0.1-embedded on pfSense ***  LAN*                     ->   sis0    ->      192.168.0.223  OPT1(OPT1)               ->   sis1    ->      NONE(DHCP)  WAN                      ->   ath0    ->      0.0.0.0(DHCP) pfSense console setup *********************** 0)  Logout (SSH only) 1)  Assign Interfaces 2)  Set LAN IP address 3)  Reset webConfigurator password 4)  Reset to factory defaults 5)  Reboot system 6)  Halt system 7)  Ping host 8)  Shell 9)  PFtop

11)  Restart webConfigurator

Enter an option: Terminated

tcsetpgrp failed, errno=25

tcsetpgrp failed, errno=25# ps -A

tcsetpgrp failed, errno=25

tcsetpgrp failed, errno=25</pre>

Besides that, I was having trouble getting the wireless card to act as the WAN port. This thread helped me get the <a href="http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php/topic,5744.msg34008.html#msg34008">wireless card to act as the wan port</a>.

I'm using a card I pulled from a Everex laptop, and its working well. I tried an intel 2915abg minipci card but it wasn't recognized. Now I'm also trying an old agere systems card 390D014 Mpci3a.

Ouch, somehow I'm getting these errors now: <textarea rows="12" cols="60"><pre>
