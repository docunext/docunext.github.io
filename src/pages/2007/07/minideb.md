I'm setting up fluxbox on a debian virtual machine:

<pre class="sh_sh">
aptitude install x-window-system
aptitude install fluxbox
aptitude install firefox</pre>

This is a great setup - so simple and lightweight, you really can't go wrong! I installed fluxbox onto a 2GB CF card and its working very well. The computer has 256MB of RAM and a very simple graphics card, but the GUI is fast and responsive. <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/hp-t5725-thin-client/">The fstab settings are very similar to the setup I have on the HP t5725</a>.
