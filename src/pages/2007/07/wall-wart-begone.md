I'm really looking forward to the arrival of a multi-port 12V power supply I ordered last week. With it, I'll be able to power multiple mini-itx and embedded devices, saving quite a bit of power supply space.

The one question that's burning in my mind is whether using one converter from AC to DC will save power. I think it will, but I'll have to try it to find out.  Here's a link to a description of the one I bought:

UPDATE August 16, 2007: I've had the multi-port 12V power supply up and running for about 3 weeks now without issue, so I'd venture to guess its ready to go in to the staging environment now. Cool, now I just have to get my hands on more <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/alix.html">ALIX boards</a>! (though I'll probably use <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/08/more-intel-little-valley-motherboards.html">intel little valley motherboards</a> as well.
