The new PC Engines mini-itx motherboard arrived from Switzerland today! The thing is COOL! It is passively cooled and only uses about 4-6 watts. Most of the time my Kill-A-Watt meter has been on 4W!

This little board costs about $150 and includes 256MB of memory. You can read more about the <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/alix_1c/">ALIX.1C in out database of energy efficient computers</a>.
