      Thanks bunches for posting the solution. I'm working on an e-book that's in landscape orientation and this is exactly the piece I needed.

I need to make FPDF output a landscape PDF instead of a portrait PDF. I also use fpdi, so I was a little unsure of how to proceed. I found this page:

<a href="http://www.fpdf.de/forum/showthread.php?t=1524">http://www.fpdf.de/forum/showthread.php?t=1524</a>

which had this code:

<pre>$pdf= new fpdi("L","pt","A4");</pre>

It works, but the scale was messed up, so I ended up just using this code instead:

<pre>$pdf= new fpdi("L");</pre>

That is awesome, I'll be experimenting with that more.
