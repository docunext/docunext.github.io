      Hi,<br/><br/>With the latest upgrade to Lion I unfortunately can't run HyperEngine-AV any more.  I came across your post here - could you please send me an Intel copy somehow?<br/><br/>Many thanks,<br/>Zoe

      Hi Phing 2.3,<br/><br/>I'm currently using Hyperengine-AV under Rosetta on Snow Leopard.  It's pretty much the only PPC app I have left now, but it's so good, it's the one major reason I'm very reluctant to move on to Lion anytime soon.  One day, though, I suppose I'll have to. ;-(<br/><br/>Well done to you for grasping the nettle and re-compiling it for Intel machines - I think you're the only person out there who's tried this!  How's it going - any progress? Have you managed to get the fade functions to work yet?<br/><br/>If you could send me a copy of your latest Intel version, I'd be very grateful.<br/><br/>All the best,<br/>Ken<br/><br/>

      Hi Ken, Unfortunately I don't know where my copy is... I've been running debian and ubuntu only these days.

      That's a real shame, but thanks for letting me know.  I guess I'm just going to have to sit on my hands and wait for the new OSX version of Lightworks to emerge.  I just hope it's as easy to use and as intuitive as Hyperengine.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Ken

      Seriously, it was so cool of them to release it as open source. I'm surprised that so few people have picked up on it to bring it up to date. I'm even surprised no one has migrated the source code to github. Maybe I'll do that to try and stir up some interest from the open source development community. If it could go cross platform (GNU/Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X... ok Windows too), that would generate interest. I'll take another look.

HyperEngine-AV is a free and open source video editor. The binary they have on sourceforge is for ppc, so I downloaded the sources and tried to compile for intel x86. It actually worked!

I was unable to open up a project I started in the PPC version, and the transitions menu doesn't include the fade options, but other than that it works OK. I'm going to see if I can fix the transitions issue because it is a very cool feature. Hmm, doesn't look like any of the transition features work in the x86 version.

Also, now when I try to open up the PPC version, it quits! :-(
