title: Selenium vs. vncrobot

I'm about to try out vncrobot which is a testing program. Before I was using Selenium for this, but in my opinion vnc looks a little more user friendly. Selenium is a great program, however, vnc seems to have more ways to customize the testing process. VNC actually has its own proprietary scripting language.
