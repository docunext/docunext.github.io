      I totally agree, I use Blackbox (sibling of Fluxbox) and I love the simplicity of it.  Almost zero configuration and it's sooo fast.  The first thing I do when installing Debian is to make it my default window manager.  I skipped Ubuntu as well for just this reason: why try to disable all the nice things in Ubuntu when it's not what you want anyway?

      Thanks for commenting Ryan. I'll have to check out Blackbox. Fluxbox is so compelling as a desktop, I'm even considering ditching OS X.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that when comparing it to GNOME, I was concerned about the ability to copy and paste to and from xterm, and even tried installing eterm, kterm, and a few others before realizing you can simply select a bunch of text, then click the middle mouse button to paste it somewhere else. Cool!

I've decided to stick with debian as my primary linux distribution of choice. I was leaning towards ubuntu for awhile there, but the lure of debian is just too strong! It rocks.

I still think ubuntu is top notch, its just that for my purposes debian fits the bill, and is easier for me to work with across the board. Its especially nice now that I figured out how to get a super-slim interface going with the help of fluxbox.
