title: Trac with MySQL and Psyco

So far (for about a week) my trac installation has been running fine with MySQL and Psyco setup. At first, I mistakenly connected the trac environment to a clone database rather than the primary origin, but luckily I caught that before too much was added to the database.

Having gone through this change, I have to say I still really like SQLite, and I'm glad I have learned more about it. For my purposes, I think it will prove a very useful resource.
