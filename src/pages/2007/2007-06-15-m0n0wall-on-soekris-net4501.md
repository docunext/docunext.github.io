      A 4501 is, of course, drastically slower than a WRAP. You're talking about a 486 133 MHz vs. a 586 266 MHz. A WRAP is more than twice as fast of a CPU. m0n0wall runs much better than anything else I've ever tried on a 4501, though the page load times are a bit slow for some pages.<br/><br/>The problem with SSH connections dying over VPN is MTU related.

      Thanks for commenting Chris, and thanks for your help on the m0n0wall lists. The 4501 is a great little device, and I'm really getting into m0n0wall. I can't believe I've survived this long without it!

Unfortunately the webGUI for m0n0wall on the net4501 is REALLY SLOW. I mean molasses. I'm wondering if I have mine configured wrong because it is so slow. Up to a minute for the page to refresh. The WRAP is much much faster. The bridging is fine (I have mine setup as a bridge filter to manage bandwidth).

I'm trying to make the net4501 perform a little faster, so I'm disabling most things that I don't need.

I just emailed the m0n0wall lists this question:

<blockquote>I'm loving m0n0wall, nice work! I'm using a soekris net4501 as a filtered bridge to manage bandwidth for a diverse network. I have a /28 subnet of public ips that I'm passing through the net4501 from wan to opt1 to a switch connecting:

* Astlinux (though soon to be askoziaPBX) on WRAP

* m0n0wall on a WRAP acting as a NAT and router for our office lan

* a couple of public servers

This allows our lan computers to access the public servers, which you can't do when using 1:1 or server NAT AFAIK.

Everything is working well, and I have the inner m0n0wall (the one on the WRAP behind the filtered bridge) connecting a VPN out to another network. That still works fine, except I'm noticing some very odd behavior. If I ssh over the VPN to a a device on the remove lan and run one of the following commands:

* ifconfig

* ps -A

something goes haywire and the shell is dropped. The process doesn't die, as I can login through the public ip and watch the top of my user and see sshd and bash continue to run after the screen buffer in the other shell through the vpn stops responding.

I'm wondering if I'm doing something that goes against good network design here, or if this is a sign of something that is mis-configured and needs to be fixed. I appreciate any advice - thanks!</blockquote>
