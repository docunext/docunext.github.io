      Yes, you really don't need a charge controller for simple single-panel setups.

I've been working on setting up a solar powered computer. My setup consists of the following:

* solar panel
* charge controller
* battery pack

I was using the charge controller with the battery pack input, but then I noticed the charge controller seriously limits the output - I think its designed for more than one solar panel of the size that I have. It was reducing the output from .25 amps to .005 amps. So no wonder it wasn't charging!

The input I'm using on the battery pack has a charge controller of its own, so I'm comfortable going directly from the panel to the battery.
