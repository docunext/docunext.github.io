      This helped indeed. I upgraded some old machines yesterday and that is what happened. I see your page is kind of old but the advice is still valid - for me. Problem solved!

Just updated courier-imapd-ssl on debian and got this error in the logs and was unable to connect:

<pre class="sh_sh">
connect: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number
</pre>

For some reason, my existing /etc/courier/imap-ssl file had:

<pre class="sh_sh">
TLS_PROTOCOL=SSL3
</pre>

I changed it to:

<pre class="sh_sh">
TLS_PROTOCOL=SSL23
</pre>

And everything worked fine again. Hope that helps!
