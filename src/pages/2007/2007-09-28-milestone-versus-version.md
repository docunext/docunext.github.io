title: Trac Milestone versus Version
date: 2007-09-28

I'm trying to organize my trac information better. The trac data model has the following elements:

<ul><li>Component</li><li>Version</li><li>Milestone</li></ul>

I was wrestling with what milestone and version meant with regard to each other, so I reviewed the Edgewall (the makers of trac) trac.

If I understand correctly, versions correspond to tagged snapshots of a subversion repository, and most likely packaged up for distribution.

Milestones are versions planned for the future which have not yet been completed.

Along those lines, I think it makes sense to only put tasks in milestones, though I'm glad that they allow the freedom to enter tickets any way you want.
