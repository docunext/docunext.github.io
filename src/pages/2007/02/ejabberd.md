Yesterday I was trying to get our Jabber server to connect to our authentication system with no avail. The server we use is very good but written in erland so its as cryptic as it gets when trying to debug. Now I'm letting it use its own authentication method which actually seems fine. I guess it really doesn't have to be integrated with everything else.

As I've noted in the past, <a href="http://www.docunext.com/acc/nxwiki/view/ejabberd-Documentation/">ejabberd can be difficult to setup</a>.
