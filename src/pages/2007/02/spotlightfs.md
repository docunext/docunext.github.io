This is awesome! This is a quick way to make some of the <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/01/tech-laggards.html">filesystem features</a> I've been looking for. Very very cool.

Sorry PC, its only for Mac.

In checking this out, I found my Spotlight was indexing way more than I wanted it to. While some people might want their email indexed, I do not. Not right now anyway, I just have too many. And while I was at it, I excluded the entire Library folder because it has too much stuff I never want to look at.

This way my Spotlight index is nice and small. Here is where I found <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/spotlight.html" rel="nofollow">instructions on Spotlight indexing, de-indexing, and links to extra Spotlight info</a>.
