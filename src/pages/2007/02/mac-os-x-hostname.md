Following up on the recent post about setting proper <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/02/22/proper-host-and-domain-name-setups/">fully qualified domain name and hostname settings in linux</a>, I'm doing the same for Mac OS X.

So far I've found different techniques:

<a href="http://www.osxfaq.com/tips/dokushoka/index.ws">OS X Faq has one technique, seems a bit dated though, since they use pico</a>

<a href="http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-development/2005/11/29/setting-a-permanent-host-name-in-mac-os-x/">This more recent post confirms that technique of setting Mac OS X hostnames via /etc/hostconfig</a>

I made the change but no effect yet. I am running Tiger, so maybe that is a problem. Perhaps a restart (GASP!) will help.
