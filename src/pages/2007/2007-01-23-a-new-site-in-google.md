      As of February 4, 2007, still only one page. :-(

On the 15th of January, 2007, the domain name docunext.com was registered. For a day or two shortly thereafter, the domain's single page of content was indexed into Google's search engine. Then, it was gone. No problem, there was hardly any information there.

Since then, 20 pages were published, all with quality, unique information covering the hosting marketplace. These pages were added to a sitemap and sumitted to Google's "tools for webmaster's" service. Now Google has automatically re-indexed the homepage. Its January 23rd, 2007, so that is pretty good.
