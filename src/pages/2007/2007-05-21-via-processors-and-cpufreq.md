      I just emailed MadTux to ask if the Vector Linux machine they are selling with the VIA C7 supports frequency scaling:<br/><br/><blockquote>I'm interested in purchasing a few of your Vector Linux VL-100 Affordable Performance PCs. When installed with Vector Linux, do they support CPU frequency scaling?</blockquote>

      They emailed me back right away (good stuff) and said that the frequency is pegged at 1.5, but since it is a new chip, the acpi for linux project might support more frequencies in the future.

The more I learn about the VIA C3, C7, and EDEN cpu chips, the more I like them. I've been trying to figure out more about how to get acpi processor frequency scaling with them. Here's been my experience so far. <b>C3</b>

I've heard that the longhaul driver works for the ASUS Terminator C3. Unfortunately I just tried it and it didn't work:

<pre>insmod /lib/modules/2.6.15-28-386/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longrun.ko

insmod: error inserting '.../longrun.ko': -1 No such device</pre>

Duh. I just spent the afternoon compiling longhaul, but then try to insmod longrun. I just insmodded longhaul and it works! :-) Unfortunately, when the processor is at its lowest frequency (400Mhz) I get this high pitched whine coming from the computer. I just installed powertweak to see if I can omit that cpu frequency from the cpu frequency adjusting daemon. If that doesn't work, I'll try to modify the scaling_available_frequencies file (though I'll probably have to do that every restart?). Powertweakd is a lot more than I need to simply alter the available frequencies. I'm instead using the cpufrequtils file in /etc/default to raise the minimum frequency to 532000 so that the cpu won't emit that annoying high pitched whine. <b>C7</b>

There is some new code for the C7 in the testing linux kernel, but for me, the acpi-cpufreq driver worked on my Everex NC1500 notebook. I think the C7 version is actually "e_powersaver.ko". Hmmm, doesn't seem like that one is supported by the C7-D. Grrr.

Now I'm trying to install gutsy gibbons, see if that helps any. For what its worth, here's a screenshot of the PC Chips motherboard BIOS:


I guess the kernel just isn't quite ready for the C7. From the stuff I've found, it looks like there are three potential candidates for cpufreq drivers for the C7:

<ul><li>acpi-cpufreq (hasn't worked for me) read reports it would work</li><li>longhaul - again, didn't work for me, got an error saying C3 Esther doesn't support frequency scaling. ???</li><li>e_powersave - read somewhere that this won't work with the C7-D</li></ul><b>EDEN</b>

I have a few C7 EDEN chips to try this out on, but haven't yet: <a href="http://www.swintabletennis.com/blog/?p=22">VIA EPIA EN 12000EG Linux kernel compile on Ubuntu</a>. I installed debian on my Eden machines, not ubuntu, but the two are so similar I hope the directions with work for both.
