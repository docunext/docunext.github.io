      Sure thing mdawaffe, I've alse submitted a few bugs to the mailing lists too, namely the urlencode bug for themes. I always put my notes here in docunext while I'm debugging and testing out new installations.

Just updated bbpress svn checkout and getting this error:

<pre>
Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated - argument passed by value; If you would like to pass it by reference, modify the declaration of [runtime function name](). If you would like to enable call-time pass-by-reference, you can set allow_call_time_pass_reference to true in your INI file. However, future versions may not support this any longer. in /usr/share/bbpress/bb-includes/classes.php on line 260</pre>
