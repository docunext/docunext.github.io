      This guy is running a WinTV-PVR-350, so I'm confident the 250 will work too.<br/><br/><a href="http://timgray.blogspot.com/2007/05/webvcr-tim-edition-update.html" rel="nofollow">http://timgray.blogspot.com/2007/05/webvcr-tim-edition-update.html</a><br/><br/>Its cool to note he's also using a VIA chip, which I am a big fan of as well. They have very low power consumption and heat emissions, both very important for machines that need to be quiet (for settop boxes) and those to be left on all the time (servers).
