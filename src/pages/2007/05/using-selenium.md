I just took a crack at using the software testing program Selenium, and I have to say I am impressed.  Although I have limited knowledge of software testing, I still found the program to be mostly self explanatory.

First you must download the FireFox plugin for your computer. Then click on tools and go to Selenium IDE.  From their you must type in the base URL of the site you are testing.  Next you click record and then start clicking the links that you wish to test on site.  Lastly you must go to the selenium window and press play in order for the program to run through the the links you clicked on to determine if it contains any errors.

I see why Selenium is such a popular program.  It makes testing easy and hassle free.
