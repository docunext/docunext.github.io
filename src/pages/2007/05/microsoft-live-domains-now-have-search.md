      Hey - glad the site was helpful - that post gets a lot of visits for similar reasons - there is not very good help in getting moved from Office Live.<br/><br/>Thanks for the link.

I just noticed for the first time that a domain I registered and continue to host for free at Microsoft Live! now has a Search box at the top left hand corner.

You can see the website in question here:

<a href="http://onlinebankmarketing.com/default.aspx">Online Bank Marketing</a>

They've always had a Microsoft Live link in the bottom right hand corner. I wonder how difficult it would be to transfer this domain away from Microsoft?

<pre><code>
   Domain Name: ONLINEBANKMARKETING.COM
   Registrar: MELBOURNE IT, LTD. D/B/A INTERNET NAMES WORLDWIDE
   Whois Server: whois.melbourneit.com
   Referral URL: http://www.melbourneit.com
   Name Server: NS1.OFFICELIVE.COM
   Name Server: NS2.OFFICELIVE.COM
   Status: clientTransferProhibited
   Updated Date: 26-apr-2007
   Creation Date: 23-apr-2006
   Expiration Date: 23-apr-2008
</code></pre>

I guess the first thing to do would be to figure out how to unlock it. I searched for "transfer away from microsoft live" and a few pages came up, one from WebMastersWorld (which I don't like, and never visit). I also searched for "microsoft live domain transfer, which returned an officeliveblog website, but when I try to visit it, I see this error:

<span style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/assets_c/2008/10/2007-05-16_officeliveblog-error.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.docunext.com/blog/assets_c/2008/10/2007-05-16_officeliveblog-error.html','popup','width=538,height=190,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">

&nbsp;Here we go, finally found a quality explanation on the subject:
