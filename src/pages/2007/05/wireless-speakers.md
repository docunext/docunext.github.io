      Absolutely! Apple has something called an Airport Express, which allows you to connect any type of audio system to your iTunes setup.<br/><br/>I believe Jeremy has one of these, so I'll ask him to chime in.

      Jeremy replied:<br/><blockquote>I have it in the house.  It’s awesome.  And super easy to set up if you are on itunes.  Plug it into the wall and connect to stereo receiver via RCA cable  to 1/4 inch.<br/>Walla.  Wireless music through your itunes.  </blockquote>

      Great! thanks for the advice, it is affordable too. Would you recommend getting the Keyspan Express remote control as well?

      I actually think you need a portable speaker system if you want it to be portable. Something like the alteclansing inmotion or the dlo iboom.

      I would love to still get some sort of outdoor/portable speaker system to go with the iPod. One that has the capabilities to also work as a radio or with a radio...

      I found another nice iPod doc that has AM/FM capabilities. It is not wireless and it is pricy but Tivoli is a good company.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tivoli-Audio-iSongBook-Portable-System/dp/B000BFGB6G" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Tivoli-Audio-iSongBook-Portable-System/dp/B000BFGB6G</a>

My husband's birthday is coming up so I am hunting for wireless speakers, indoor or ourdoor. I'd love something that can be hooked right to an iPod but can also be hooked up to a receiver or a computer. Any suggestions?

<strong>Requirements</strong>:

iTunes Integration

Portability

Airport Express Compatibility?
