      Computer cases need better design though. Back in the day I had my computer case painted in an auto body shop: green, red, with a silver fade. It looked awesome. Then Apple came out with the iMac, which were a big improvement over the beige boxes which have been around forever. I like the Alienware computers that are available now too.<br/><br/>I've always wanted a wooden and glass computer for some reason. Tried to build one years ago but it didn't come out very good.

Nothing beats a good looking case for a computer, there is something about it that says, "I'm so techno-savy even my machine looks good." However some people take it to a level that I can't even believe. Check out this mouse and case made by a taxidermist. I would classify this as out of control.
