      I had exactly same problem when upgrading from 6.10 to 7.0.4.<br/><br/>I tried to twist the /var/lib/dpkg/xfonts-scalable.preinst, postinst...<br/><br/>The problem seems to be the update-fonts-dir does not support -x11layout, may not be accurate, but something like that...<br/><br/>Not be able to resolved it right now... and ever worse, I can not have my X working right now....<br/><br/>looking forward to a fix...

      I had the same problem, while upgrading from edgy to feisty.<br/>Then I upgraded xfonts-utils first (it contains update-fonts-dir).<br/>This new update-fonts-dir accepts the -x11layout option.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Mate

      Thanks for that tip Mate - totally appreciate it. I actually nuked my machine that was giving me those issues and now use it as a LTSP client, but its good to know. Hopefully your tip will help charlie above.<br/><br/>Instead of xubuntu, I'm now using debian with fluxbox, even lighter and simpler than xubuntu. A little harder to setup but not by much.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/minideb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/2007/07/minideb.html</a>

Could this error be related:

<pre>perl: warning: Setting locale failed.</pre>

Attempted fixes:

This completed without a problem:

<pre>locale-gen en_US</pre>

This also reported the same perl error, but generated a slew of locales:

<pre>dpkg-reconfigure locales</pre>

This link makes me believe that the error will eventually go away: <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/59062">
Locale error - perl: warning: Setting locale failed.</a>

Nope, its still not fixed. Found <a href="http://cse.ucdavis.edu/users/sbeards/blog/fix-locale-errors-in-ubuntu">
this tip on how to fix locale errors in ubuntu</a>
, but it didn't work for me either. :-(

I had tried using gutsy gibbons, but now I'm using edgy eft. It appears that a newer version of openoffice was installed that might have been messing things up. I've removed it and am now trying a dist-upgrade.

So x windows fonts keep showing up as squares, not good. I've dpkg-reconfigured just about everything but still no luck. Grrr. I hate having to do it but I re-installed ubuntu 7.04.
