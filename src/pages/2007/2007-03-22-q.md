The developers over at kju-app.org have been busy, so I've updated my svn checkout and am recompiling the latest version now.

Plenty of errors, but I think they happened last time I compiled:

<pre>../dyngen-exec.h:231: warning: '__op_param1' defined but not used../dyngen-exec.h:231: warning: '__op_param2' defined but not used</pre>

Yup, it worked. But its strange. It appears that the latest checkout is not the latest version. Hmmm.
