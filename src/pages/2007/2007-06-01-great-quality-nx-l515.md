      Actually suspend is when the computer puts the state into ram, and hibernate is when it stores it on the hard drive.

I bought a <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/01/350-laptop-arrived/">$350 notebook</a> from Fry's outpost.com. I didn't know what to expect, but I'm really impressed, with both the great quality of "Great Quality", as well as the awesomeness of Ubuntu. Everything works! Even the screen dimmer, which brought its energy consumption down to a cool 18 watts.

It "Suspends" without a hitch, but won't hibernate. I bet that has something to do with it only having 512MB of RAM.

Also, the wireless card "RaLink" isn't working. It causes the machine to freeze up. I have a couple of extra minipci cards I can try instead.
