      You might want to look at <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" rel="nofollow">Doxygen</a> which also reads the Javadoc syntax, and which IMHO generates a lot nicer output.

I submitted some projects to ohloh.net recently, then came up with thoughts to share.

* raises awareness about the importance of code commenting
* inaccurate analysis of code?

With regard to code commenting syntax, why does it appear so bizarre to me? Like this:

<pre>
@param paramname:
</pre>

Is this some sort of documentation markup I'm unfamiliar with?

I just tried playing with ohloh some more and it is really really cool. I'm looking forward to surfing it some more.

UPDATE - Yes, the code comment syntax is called <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>. Speaking of which, this looks awesome: <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc/</a>, and this <a href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/documentation.html">page</a> looks helpful.

UPDATE 2 December 25, 2007: I just realized that there is a serious problem with ohloh - included libraries. For example, I submitted PBooks, which includes a great calendar javascript program, which I didn't write. Ohloh then made the mis-judgement that PBooks was mostly written in javascript. How can this get worked out? [ <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/wiki/mostly_written" rel="nofollow">related</a> ]
