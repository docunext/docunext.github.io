I'm sure everybody who has run a virtual machine has thought about running a virtual machine on top of that. Here's the same idea with a twist:

<strong>Run Fedora in Parallels on Macintosh, then run kqemu in it to get the same virtual machine I already have to run faster! </strong>

Could work, could fail miserably. Not sure if its worth it because I'm sure that since kqemu has been released open source, it will soon be ported and included in regular old Q.

This looks good:
