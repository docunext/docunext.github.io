title: Canceled VPSLink Account

Also due to lack of use, I'm canceling my VPSLink.com account. I like the idea of creating and canceling VPS accounts on an ad-hoc basis; if you need to try something new and don't want to use your existing hardware for it. I may just return to VPS Link at some point, they have a quality service at a great price.

I really need to setup a virtualization system in-house at some point, but who knows when I'll find the time to do that.
