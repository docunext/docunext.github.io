Netfirms ran a promotion I could not say no to: 2 domains and a year of hosting for $10!

<b>January 19, 2007</b>
Netfirms hosted domain is non-responsive. Receiving a timed out error. In a few hours the website was again reachable, not sure how long it took though.

<b>NetFirms Commerce Pro</b>

Netfirms offers osCommerce, which is a surprisingly complex and sophisticated piece of software. I'm not sure how many Netfirms customers actually use it, but its nice to know that it is available.

<b>Database Connections</b>
Today (January 21, 2007), I've had two database connections fail. Upon refresh, the connection was successful.
