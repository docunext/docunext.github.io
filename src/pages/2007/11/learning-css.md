      Good work, Max. CSS is pretty straightforward, but it can do so much as well. Once you get the idea down, I'll show you how to apply CSS to classes and specific div tags.

      Also remind me to show you how to use an external CSS file.

This is just some CSS formating I was playing with earlier:<font style="color: red;">this is some red text </font><font style="color: purple;">this is some purple text </font><p style="text-align: center;">this is center aligned</p><p style="text-align: right;">this is right aligned</p><font style="text-decoration: overline">this text is overlined</font><font style="font-style: italic">this is italic font</font>
