      "they are liar"... Indeed.<br/><br/>Dreamhost is a wonderful SHARED hosting provider - the key is SHARED.  You'd have to be bonkers to think hosting any kind of mission-critical application on a shared host is a good idea.<br/><br/>I have sent many clients to Dreamhost to get their feet wet in the internet biz and they absolutely love it.  It is perfect for blogging or learning about the web - Customer support is usually pretty quick to respond to issues and they are all around great dudes.  The point is that when you buy a Ford Tempo, you know you are getting a bad car - but it gets you where you gotta go and occasionally breaks down.<br/><br/>I really would like to see what kind of production apps you are running that Dreamhost can't handle, I do find it hard to believe.<br/><br/>Anyway, in conclusion - Dreamhost is pretty much the best of the worst, they have their good and bad points as any shared host does - at least this Tempo has shell privs...

      I was very happy when I opted for dreamhost...<br/>for one month I had no problem<br/>but since last 3 days I had to face 3 downtime and the major one is still gng on for two hours and right now I'm so mad I'm sure you can imagine how will you feel when your website is down.<br/><br/>I hope they improve there QOS.<br/>I\'m planning to move to another host soon coz I can't take any more downtime.<br/>What if google tries to index my pages and it will see that all the pages are unreachable only this thought scaring me.<br/>Oh wait there is another thought I have applied for Google adsense and Im sure they going to have a look meantime and what if my account gt disapproved because of that. :(

Last year I signed up for a Dreamhost account. I used a coupon code so the price wasn't bad, and their offering is very competitive in many ways. However, the past year has been very disappointing to me. I was hosting several websites there and on one occasion the service was totally shut down for several days. Frankly, I was absolutely floored that they would allow something to happen. I was able to transfer the more important sites off to another host (one that I manage myself), so the damage to me personally was minimal.

Besides that nightmare, I feel that the overall service quality is not good enough for my needs. I'm sure its good enough for many, but I'm not happy with the performance of their machines or their bandwidth. On the flip side, I'm not having very much fun transferring my remaining sites away from Dreamhost, but unless I want to stay with them forever (which I don't) I have to do it sometime, and I might as well do it now.

What do you think of dreamhost? For the money, I agree, its not bad. But if I had the choice to pay more for better service, I would.
