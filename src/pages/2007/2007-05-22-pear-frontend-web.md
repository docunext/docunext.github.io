This is the way to go. Nice work Greg! I set this up on a debian machine. Here's what I did: <ol><li>Copied the index.php.txt file to a web accessible directory</li><li>Then added "/etc/pear/pear.conf" to index.php for the optional pear conf file</li><li>Then I chowned /use/share/php to www-data.</li></ol>

Now we can go channel surfing for packages! Woo-hoo!
