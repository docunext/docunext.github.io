      Please elaborate about your experience in going through the procedure, not just the nuts and bolts. What's the story behind it? And what you posted there is only half the story, you didn't talk about the installer!!!

      I forget, what type of operating system is debian<br/><br/>4:00<br/><br/>linux<br/><br/>4:00<br/><br/>yeah thats right<br/><br/>4:00<br/><br/>but debian is the "universal operating system"<br/><br/>4:01<br/><br/>now what do you mean by that....so is debian a specific type of linux operating system kind of like windows xp is a version of the windows os<br/><br/>4:02<br/><br/>hmmm, its not really the same... but as you know, you installed version 4, which was just officially released earlier this month.<br/><br/>03:13<br/>Whereas Windows has version "XP", debian has versions 3 and 4, 3 was nicknamed sarge (I think), and 4 is nicknamed etch.<br/><br/>4:03<br/><br/>gotcha<br/><br/>4:03<br/>interesting<br/><br/>05:15<br/>why are there so many versions whereas windows is so limited<br/><br/>as far as linux goes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of variations, usually called the different "flavors" of linux<br/><br/>millions of people all over the world are all working on it together, and they all have different opinions of how it should work, whereas windows is developed by a much smaller pool of developers, with much different, and much narrower, objectives. at least that's what I think.<br/><br/>depends on the version, ubuntu and debian are very similar, whereas gentoo is in its own world, same with slackware. Centos, whitebox, and red hat are similar, the differences are often clear in how the software is managed, but also the objective.<br/><br/>13:53<br/>Ubuntu is trying to be user friendly, while debian is staunchly free, gentoo is for cutting edge developers, and red hat is for corporate customers<br/><br/>14:33<br/>linux is an entirely different type of computing than windows, and linux is just a part of unix, which also include the bsd family: freebsd, netbsd, and openbsd.

Today I installed Debian for the first time.  I am use to using windows but I hear a lot of good things about Linux systems.  Also I am trying to dive deeper into the computer world and learn what they can do, and what their different functions are.  At this point, I'm just getting my feet wet, and experimenting with different programs and aspects of computers. These are just some quick notes I took down.

Went to debian.org

under getting debian, click on cd ISO images

Download cd/dvd images using HTTP or FTP

U.S. mirrors kernel HTTP

386/

iso-cd/

debian.....net.inst.iso

downloaded iso recorder

burned image to disc
