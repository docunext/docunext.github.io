      Howdy Al,<br/><br/>I've had pretty good luck with Cedega. If the games are popular, they do a pretty good job of supporting them. However, after years of trying to run games with Cedega on Linux. I have a full time dedicated Windows machine for that now.

      Sup J - you mentioned cedega before but I forgot the name. Too bad its commercial, but I guess it takes a lot of work to keep up with the games.

I'm wondering why linux hasn't been able to get more video games going on it. I think it has something to do with OpenGL versus Microsoft's "Direct" 3D rendering library, but I'm really not sure. I know there are some Wine-like tools which allow linux computers to play video games, but they are commercial programs. This is something I'm going to do more research on, and if anyone has any pointers, I'd appreciate it.

This looks like a good lead:
