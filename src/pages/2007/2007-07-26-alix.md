      Hi,<br/><br/>I'm from Brazil and I am very interested in this specific motherboard. Could you tell me how this board is working? Which OS are you using? The shipping to you country was expensive?<br/><br/>Thanks for the attention, I'm waiting to hear from you<br/><br/>David Kwast

      Hi David,<br/><br/>Obrigado! I probably spelled that wrong, but greetings from the USA! Glad you found our website. This board is awesome! I just did a bunch of tests on it using the geode-aes security block and the results are amazing for such a minimal board:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/My_Notes_on_Patching_2.6.22_with_OCF" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/wiki/My_Notes_on_Patching_2.6.22_with_OCF</a><br/><br/>I've shipped a couple of batches from Switzerland and found the prices for using Swiss Post were much better than using UPS, more about that here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.informedshipping.com/blog/2007/08/24/ups-international-shipping-ouch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.informedshipping.com/blog/2007/08/24/ups-international-shipping-ouch/</a><br/><br/>The shipping for swiss post in my experience ranged from $30 - $50 USD depending on weight.<br/><br/>Where in Brazil are you? I visited Rio, San Paulo, and Brasilia as a youth - it is a beautiful country. :)

      You spelled that right! Correct me if I'm wrong but I've found this board there in mini-box (http://www.mini-box.com/Alix-1C-Board-1-LAN-1-MINI-PCI?sc=8&amp;category=99). I think that it may be a little cheaper than ordering from Zürich.<br/><br/>I am in Sao Paulo and incredibly I never went to Rio and Brasilia. I'm interest in this board to do multimedia applications like Jukebox controlled by XML-RPC, BlueTooth, etc.<br/><br/>I visited Disney World twice when I was young.<br/><br/>Feel free to contact me by e-mail to talk more about embedded solutions.<br/><br/>Best regards

      Hi David, that is indeed the same board, I didn't know mini-box had them in stock. I've also ordered from them and was satisfied with their service. FYI - the ALIX doesn't need a power supply (but it does need an adapter), but mini-box makes some great power supplies for other mini-itx boards like the D201GLY intel little valley. See this information for more about that:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/22/intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board/" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/blog/2007/06/22/intels-little-valley-mini-itx-board/</a><br/><br/>I like the PW-200M for the d201ly, and the picoPSU for the dg965ss, though that board isn't mini-itx.<br/><br/>What voltage is the electricity in Brazil? And plug design?

My new PC Engines ALIX motherboard / computer arrived from Switzerland yesterday, here are some pictures:



This thing is awesome. It is my new "favorite"! Comes with 256MB of RAM, an on-board graphics card, 44-pin storage headers, compact flash slot, 10/100 ethernet, serial port, mini-pci port, full size pci slot, and on-board power supply (meaning you don't need a separate power supply like the PicoPSU, you can just plug in a 12V power supply. Receptacle is 2.5mm id and 5.5 od - I think!).

Oh yeah, only uses 4-6 watts of power under normal use, and makes no noise as it doesn't have a fan. It doesn't even need a heatsink!

UPDATE August 16th, 2007: The plug receptacle is indeed 2.5mm id and 5.5mm od, at least that's the size on my ALIX board. Check with PC Engines for exact measurements.

UPDATE November 11, 2007: More pictures of the ALIX-series boards:
