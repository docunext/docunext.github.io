We had a broken ibook G3 on our hands. It had a strange "snow" on the screen, vertical lines in odd patterns across the screen. To retrieve the data we had to set the laptop up as a firewire target. First we rest the pram by pressing - option-apple-p-r, then startup the machine holding down t. Plug in the firewire cable to another mac, and retrieve the data to the new machine.

Things to look out for:

<ul><li>Make sure there is nothing in the cd drive of the target machine.</li><li>The machine that is being targeted will have a floating yellow Y graphic on the screen while you are retrieving the data.</li><li>Be sure the machine you are moving data to has enough memory to hold the info.</li></ul>
