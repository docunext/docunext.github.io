      That's a "kernel panic" by the way.

Well the G4 was passed off to me today. I just had to clear it of all it's old data. I inserted an install CD and held down C as I rebooted. When the machine restarted it had the following screen.<a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/p1010224.JPG" title="Startup Image" class="thickbox">

I was a little irritated that during the setup process of the machine it forces you to register with mac, however it let me put in completely fake data, so it's not really that big a deal. Not to mention I'm simply delighted to have a functioning machine again.
