I'm building a new computer, should be really nice! Here's a quick snapshot:

It has an AMD processor, Seagate hard drive, ATI graphics card, and Elitegroup mainboard. I think all these were bought from Newegg awhile ago. If you want, check out <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/">my tech deals</a> for the tech products I buy and where I buy them from.
