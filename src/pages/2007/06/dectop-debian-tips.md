      Nice tips!<br/>I have just bought one, and I am wondering what performances I can hope : actually, I would install subversion, trac, apache, mysql, so do you think I dream?

      You should be OK, but you might run out of RAM, and take note that the USB - Ethernet dongle is USB 1.1, meaning it is really slow.

      I will get my Dectop in the next few days. And I saw that you added the sound-modules to the blacklist file. Is there a sound support for the dectop yet?<br/><br/>I'll rant about my experience with the Dectop in my blog. (in german)  ;)

      Ok after I played a bit around I can now see why you have added the sound modules to the blacklist ;) I have a few things on my todo list, but so far I am sure I can install the dectop into my car to do the dirty wlan/gps work for me.

      Hi Christopher! That is a great idea for the dectop. What wlan / gps unit are you going to use? I guess it would have to be USB?

      Hi Albert. I will buy one from a tech dealer named Reichelt. I haven't looked for a particular one. I thought to use a bluetooth usb adapter to connect a bluetooth GPS unit and if possible at the same time a bluetooth enabled mobil phone.<br/><br/>I have some problems with the dectop. Firstly, the internal hard disk isn't powered down after the dectop shuts off. It keeps spinning till I remove the power plug. :/ Therefore I need some hardware solution to cut the power connection between the dectop and car battery, or otherwise my diesel wouldn't start the next time. (OkOK.. Only if i leave the dectop on for quite a while)

## <strong>Here are some of my notes I took while installing Debian GNU/Linux on the dectop.</strong>

Edit /etc/default/acpid:

<pre># Specify options for acpid startup, Debian default is to enable the
# use of sockets at a non-default position
OPTIONS="-s /var/run/acpid.socket"
# Specify modules to load on acpid's startup
# MODULES may be uncommented to load "none", contain the string "all"
# to load all acpi related modules or simply a space seperated list
# of modules to be probed.#MODULES="battery ac processor button fan thermal"
MODULES="none"</pre>

Add to the bottom of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist (this will remove sound!):

<pre>
blacklist snd
blacklist ipv6
blacklist snd_cs5535audio
blacklist snd_ac97_codec
blacklist snd_pcm
blacklist snd_timer
blacklist snd
blacklist battery
blacklist pcspkr
blacklist fan
blacklist processor
blacklist thermal</pre>

Remove device mapper from init scripts:

<pre>update-rc.d -f libdevmapper1.02 remove</pre>

Comment out the extra consoles in inittab, leaving one for general console access. Speaking of which, its too bad that the dectop doesn't have an rs232 / db9 serial connector. :-(

Even though the dectop doesn't have a fan, I've listed "none" in the acpid config, and have them blacklisted, fan, thermal, and processor are still loading upon boot. Not sure how to keep them from getting loaded short of stopping acpi altogether Any suggestions?

With those changes, debian only needs approximately 21MB of ram, leaving up to 80MB of ram for your other stuff!

Your could reduce it even more by turning off cron and syslog, but for now I'll keep those around.
