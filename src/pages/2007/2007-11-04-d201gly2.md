      This has a different CPU on it (intel celeron 220) to the D201GLY and hopefully lower power consumption. From xtreview.com/addcomment-id-3556-view-New-Celeron-220.html :<br/><br/>'On 21 October Intel company will present new processor for use in mini-ITX motherboards . It is known to us by the name Celeron 220 (1.2 GHz). This processor has the lower frequency and equal cache volume in the second level (512 KB) , this processor has lower TDP in comparison with preceding celeron 215 (1.33 GHz).<br/><br/>We succeeded in learning, that this nonconformity is caused by the passage of processor to Conroe- L core. Let us recall that Celeron 215 (1.33 GHz) was based on mobile core yonah, and it do not support 64-bit expansions. The TDP level of this processor was equal to 27 W. Passage to the desktop core Conroe- L will allow not only the 64- bit expansions support  , but also will lower level TDP to 19 W. It is understandable that increase in speed will occur, in spite of reduction in the frequency from 1.33 GHz to 1.2 GHz.<br/><br/>The processor celeron 220 (1.2 GHz) will be more expensive than its predecessor by four dollars, since its wholesale price is equal to $58. If we considers that this processor will be used in  intel D201GLY2 motherboard on base of chipset SiS 662, whose retail price will not exceed $90-100 (cost of processor is included on), addition in price can distress potential buyers. However, increase in speed and 64-bit applications compensate in certain degree the price increase . '

      Hi Guy, Thanks for that info. I'm very interested to learn what the power consumption on the new processor is like.

intel is finally getting the little valley 2 out into the marketplace, and this thing is awesome. Its got SATA and a passively cooled CPU. What more could you ask for from a mini-itx system board? All for around $75. AWESOME!

UPDATE November 6, 2007: I just did a little research on this motherboard, the part number is also referred to as LAD201GLY2T or LAD201GLY2, but only the one with the "T" at the end has the TV out port.
