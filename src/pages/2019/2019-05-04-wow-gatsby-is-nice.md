I just spent the past few hours learning about gatsby, a powerful content
aggregator / site generator that uses GraphQL and React. Its totally badass.

Then I took the past half hour and converted docunext to use it.

Granted, docunext.com was already using jekyll, so it was in an easy to manage
state. Still, the fact that I was able to do this so quickly is really
impressive. I'm going to keep at this.
