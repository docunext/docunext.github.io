      I still find there to be an issue.<br/><br/>I have resources :assets in my routes, and when I run rake routes it does not include assets! I also get the routing error when I try to use my application.<br/><br/>I currently do no have a fix. Maybe rename my resource or put it into a namespace. Damn :(.

      Yes, unfortunately this *still* broken in Rails 3.1.1 and as near as I can tell from digging through patches, pull-requests and fixes this one has still been missed totally and is not fixed.<br/><br/>I just did some testing on the newest release of Rails and you can't have a route that starts with "/assets" at all - even "/assetszyzzy" or "/assets_info".  The rake routes task is still hiding (rejecting) any route that begins with "assets" and is not using the value from config.assets.prefix like the sprokets helpers are doing now.

      Argh, that's too bad. Although they are related, that problem is different than the one I was talking about. It sounds like the situation flipped - previously config.assets.prefix would avoid a controller catching /assets requests, but the helpers weren't using config.assets.prefix.<br/><br/>From what you've described, the helpers are using config.assets.prefix, but the default routes are still getting generated. I'll take a look and try to figure out what's happened.

I've run into an error with the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline where one of my controllers happens to be named AssetsController:

<div class="rails-trace">
<h1>Routing Error</h1>
<p><pre>No route matches {:action=&gt;&quot;show&quot;, :controller=&gt;&quot;assets&quot;, :id=&gt;&quot;web-app-theme/base&quot;, :format=&gt;&quot;css&quot;, nil=&gt;:request}</pre></p>
</div>

Hmmm. What to do? First, an explanation.

#### The Rails 3.1 Assets "Controller"

Here's what's happening:

* I have an assets controller, so I also have the following in my config/routes.rb file: <tt>resources :assets</tt>.
* I am using the new asset pipeline in Rails 3.1.
* I tried renaming the assets path like so: <tt>config.assets.prefix = "/s"</tt>, but it apparently didn't work.
* I can confirm its a name collision because if I comment out the resources line in config/routes.rb, there is no error.

#### Working Around the Assets Controller Name Collision

I figure there are a few options:

* Namespace my assets controller to be Accounts::AssetsController. I had originally opted agains that for simplicities sake, but it might be a solid solution. I do not want to namespace my models though.
* Find another configuration setting to alter the "assets" name for the asset pipeline. There is <tt>config.assets.manifest</tt>, but that is for pre-compiling assets, not accessing them.

Ultimately it seems that the nexus of this problem is that the tag helpers do not use the custom <tt>config.assets.prefix</tt> value. Thankfully, there has been a [commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2684f17a17e4f97bdb89d20b4cd08585235263a2) to fix it. Alas, it seems to have been overlooked in recent tags and releases.

As a quick workaround, I'm not using the tag helpers, just accessing the css files directly.

**UPDATE**: Hooray! Rails developer spastorino pulled request [3092](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3092) to fix this issue. That is so great. FWIW - my initial experience working with the Rails development community has been positively impressive.
