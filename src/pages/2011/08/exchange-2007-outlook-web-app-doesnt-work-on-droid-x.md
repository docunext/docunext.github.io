While I'm not surprised that the Exchange 2007 Outlook Web App doesn't work on my [Droid X](http://www.soggyblogger.com/blog/droid/), I'm still disappointed.

The Outlook Web App is actually not that bad, and while I initially really liked the Droid X, its actually decreased in reliability, and over time, I've discovered I have many complaints about it, such as the poor keyboard performance and the not-so-intelligent type ahead.

There are a couple things I like about the Exchange 2007 Outlook Web App, such as the calendar. In general though, I can't accept that Microsoft doesn't support any other mail clients besides Outlook. That is totally anti-competitive, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Department of Justice took their butt back to court!

UPDATE: I was wrong! Exchange 2007 Outlook Web App **does** work with the Droid X browser. One of my co-workers also has a Droid X and said it worked for him, so I gave it a second try and voila! Indeed, the Outlook Web App (OWA) in Exchange 2007 **does** work with the WebKit-powered Droid X browser. The screen is tight, but its definitely usable and useful.
