Facebook might sue Mark Zuckerberg! OMG!

#### Getting Sued by Facebook for Fun and Profit

Haha! This is not an April Fool joke in December - apparently an Israeli named
Rotem Guez who found himself the threats of a lawsuit from Facebook by marketing
"likes" through his Like Store decided to change his name to Mark Zuckerberg.

Maybe someone else (not me) is going to change his name to Rotem Guez! Will you?
Why not?!?!?

Or maybe we'll see a new skateboarding video titled "Rotem Guez: Have You Seen
Him?" - a reference to Animal Chin, of course.
