      I have a sinking suspicion that this search functionality will upset some people. Picture this: using Google coop, sites can essentially "feature" content from other sites, who may not want to be "featured" on other sites. I bet there will be lawsuits, but in the end, Google will have more people "opting-in".

Another giant leap! This new system that Google is offering for people to make their own search engines represents a quantum leap in search technology. I'm so thrilled Google has come up with this type of offering.

Here's what it does:

* Individuals and groups can act as "editors" of sorts, specifying certain websites as providing interesting content on various subjects.
* Google then provides a search engine which searches within those websites, or emphasizes the results from those pages.
* The search engine maintainers are rewarded for their work through AdSense revenue.

This is awesome!
