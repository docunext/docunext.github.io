I'm writing this from my [2006 Toyota Corolla](http://www.neocarz.com/blog/toyota/). No, I'm not driving, but we are moving at 60mph on route 95 North from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts. I'm posting via my 2Ghz Macbook, connected via bluetooth to my Motorola e815 mobile phone, which is in turn connected to the Verizon Wireless EVDO network. My favorite aspect to this technical configuration is that it does not incur any additional charges besides normal minute consumption.

Here's a howto on <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2006/04/nokia770-motorola-e815-and-verizonwireless/">connecting a Nokia 770 to the internet with bluetooth and Verizon Wireless</a>.

Postscript: If you don't know - the Corolla gets amazing gas mileage ~ 40 miles per gallon on the highway. [W00t](http://www.docunext.com/2009/11/w00t/)!
