      Actually I have to take it back, integrating isn't as hard as it seemed. With a little hacking, I've been able to use my existing WP theme. Awesome! Still having issues with the login fields, but I think I can fix it.<br/>

Wordpress is good software, and so I'm looking into bbpress, the new forum software from the same developers. So far, I'm really disappointed. I expected Wordpress integration, and while possible, its not there. I did get it to work for <a href="http://www.informedbanking.com/">Informed Banking</a>, and was constantly wonder why the two are seemingly so different when it comes to the basics, like cookies, login, and user info.

What really blows my mind is the difference between themes. Thinking you can use your Wordpress theme with bbpress? Forget about it.

So it makes me wonder why bbpress is being developed, with existing, mature, and free packages like phpbb2 and vanilla easily available?
