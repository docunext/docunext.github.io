      I would like to contact you for a consultation regarding low cost Linux boxes, but I couldn't find any contact information in this blog. Please update me with your contact information.

I've got a few <a href="http://www.docunext.com/">KVM</a> images planned, and I'd like to automate the process, so I'm coming up with a few ideas to jot down.

* Python Moin-Moin
* <a href="http://www.docunext.com/">Askozia PBX</a>
* Jabber - djabberd or ejabberd?
