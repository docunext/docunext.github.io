      I ended up doing this manually in the selenium javascript, not the best way but it works.

      We had the same problem, trying to get a reduced execution speed.<br/><br/>The proposed selenium core attribute *runInterval* does not work for some reason (???).<br/><br/>So we use the setSpeed(millies) function from the selenium api.<br/><br/>We use this function in a case that is used by every selenium suite at start up. So we have it available in all suites and all cases.

I wish I could set the Selenium speed in the test suite file.... and for individual tests for that matter.
