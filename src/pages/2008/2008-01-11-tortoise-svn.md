      Hello, is it possible for you to put the whole post in the RSS feed? I read the blogs via an RSS Reader (Straw), and I often leave the house, my RSS reader downloads all the blogs in the morning and I might not have the network after that.

      Max - as I explained today, the checkout / commit isn't exactly like Dreamweaver's PUT command, but they are similar enough to make the comparison. When you commit new changes via subversion, they don't go to a live site like with dreamweaver, they go to the repository, which can't be run directly. I then check them out onto another server to run  the application, run the test, or serve the page.

Tortoise SVN is a subversion client that is implemented as a Microsoft Windows Explorer extension.  It is used to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation.

Subversion keeps a running log of the changes that have been made to a site and the user who made the changes.  This makes it easier to manage the site and pinpoint mistakes or unnecessary changes, and Tortoise gives you access to check out files and commit back changes to them.

Tortoise is similar to Dreamweaver in the fact that both programs use a local version of the site that is stored on your desktop.  This local version is the template that you use to make changes and add files.  The update command in Tortoise is similar to the put command in Dreamweaver in the sense that they take the changes you made on your local copy, and then apply them to the live version.
