title: mod proxy is awesome

I've been trying all the different configurations for mod_proxy the past few days - balancer, cache, and even the mod_proxy_http module. Its all very very cool.

One thing I'm definitely interested in figuring out is how to combine the conditional powers of mod_rewrite with the failover capabilities of balancer.
