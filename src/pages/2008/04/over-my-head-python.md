I'm still trying to learn python, and while this post from a debian developer is a bit over my head, I found it an interesting read:

<a href="http://azure.humbug.org.au/~aj/blog/2008/04/10#2008-04-10-select-and-generators" rel="nofollow">Select and Python Generators</a>

The concepts of threading, blocking, locking, buffers are starting to make sense to me, but I still need more exposure to them for it all to make sense. Those concepts are not specific to python though, they can be found in many languages.

AJ's post introduced me to the python concept of generators, as well as python "yield". I'll have to try out yield and pass to see if I can get a better idea of how they work.
