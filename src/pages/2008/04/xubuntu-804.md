I've been updating a few of my laptops to XUbuntu 8.04 and its markedly improved. I like XUbuntu because it runs well on machines with low RAM and video RAM, yet is still compatible with most common desktop applications.

I'm just about done with another upgrade and it should be good!

Crud! Unfortunately the system froze up during the update-manager install, now I'm running  apt-get -f install. I wonder if this was caused by canceling the first update-manager -d. That caused the meta information file to get hosed, so then I updated my sources file and ran apt-get upgrade and apt-get upgrade-conf.
