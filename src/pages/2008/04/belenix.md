      Nice to know that you liked it :)<br/><br/>That text which you see is the standard opensolaris text. We've not done anything to change it all.<br/><br/>The terms for belenix itself would be CDDL, I think. I'll talk to the group and we'll pay attention to these points.

      Hi Shiv, Sriram, Anil and Manish - wow you are one the ball! Thanks so much for commenting on this. I'm going to install BeleniX on an extra desktop tomorrow so I can keep playing with it. :-)

I tried using the <a href="http://www.genunix.org/distributions/belenix_site/?q=home">BeleniX</a> liveCD today and I was actually pretty impressed. One question though: when it starts up, there is text that says copyright Sun Microsystems, usage subject to license terms. It doesn't say what those terms are, though. GPL v2, I presume?

I liked that the liveCD gives you the choice of using XFCE, KDE, or Compiz - surprising. Totally cool.
