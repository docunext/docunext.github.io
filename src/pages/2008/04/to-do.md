I made it through a couple of recent tasks I set myself out to complete - but I still have the backups to do. I also still have to configure my <a href="http://www.my-tech-deals.com/blog/2007/06/12/apc-pdu/">APC switched power distribution unit (PDU)</a>. Its more sophisticated and expensive than the other web switch I have, but takes more to set it up. It also consumes more power by itself, which was kind of disappointing.

TO-DO: * Configure APC PDU on glass network.

<pre code="bash">
arp -s 192.168.8.251 00:c0:b7:7c:1a:ca
ping 192.168.8.251 -s 113</pre>
