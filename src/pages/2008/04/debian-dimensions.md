I visit Planet Debian several times a day. Lately there's been a lot of chatter about Debian politics I have no clue about, but most of the time I'm thinking stuff like "that's awesome", "I can relate", "wow", and similar feelings.

One of the Debian politics things that's surfaced on Planet Debian recently which I'm pleased I read compared Debian Planet to some other Debian resources I didn't know much about:

* <a href="http://times.debian.net/">http://times.debian.net/</a>
* <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews">http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews</a>
* <a href="http://debaday.debian.net/">http://debaday.debian.net/</a>

Unfortunately, when searching for Debian news - I would always come across the seemingly defunct <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/">http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/</a> (no entries for 2008?).

I'm also wondering - is there a place where the popularity-contest statistics are revealed? YES!
