Again I'm impressed. As I explain here, its been a long time since <a href="http://www.docunext.com/#How_I_feel_about_Debian">I've been so impressed with something as much as I am with Debian and its groups of fine folks</a>.

I say "again" because after a few days of people making some noise on <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">planet debian</a> (and likely elsewhere I don't happen to be listening at the moment) about approved debian developers (DDs) waiting to get their accounts activated for several months, the gates flung open and a bunch were activated.

I'm sure I'm a little ignorant when I say that "communication is the grease that makes big groups and teams function", as I have very little experience with big groups or teams, but in this case I really think it did the trick.

Congratulations to all the new DDs!
