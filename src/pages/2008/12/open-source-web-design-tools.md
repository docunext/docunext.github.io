Most open source software involved with web design is for the back-end, like databases, web servers, and scripting languages. However, there are some powerful tools for designing and crafting websites themselves.

These include the following programs:
<ul><li>Bluefish - HTML and Scripting IDE
</li><li>The GIMP - Graphical Image Manipulation Program
</li><li>mozilla-cascades - Stylesheet editor</li><li>Screem - Gnome website development toolkit</li><li>Gphpedit - scripting and html editor</li></ul> I've worked with Bluefish a bunch and liked it a lot, but the version I used was still a little buggy.
