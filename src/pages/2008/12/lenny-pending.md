Seems like things are calming down with Lenny, even though Debian planet is very active with discussions about the release process in general. I don't mind that the Debian project takes things slow, that's actually one of the reasons why I really like the project.

There are plenty of linux distributions which stay on the cutting edge, and in many cases, I prefer to take things slow and steady. I embraced Lenny early only because of the kernels available in it. These newer kernels have support for energy saving features of newer CPUs, so I couldn't resist!
