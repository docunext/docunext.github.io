Yesterday I took my Debian GNU/kFreeBSD machine out for a spin. Its always cool to see the debian logo in ascii upon boot! :-)

Anyway I did an apt-get update and an apt-get upgrade and all went totally smooth. I'm still getting the inotify error and a couple other I can't remember upon boot, but it is really so cool to use this new operating system combo.

My Debian GNU/kFreeBSD setup:* intel d201gly* vesa x11 driver* standard i386 install* gnome desktop environment
