      The quotes you mentioned for the repair seem too high to me. I would tell the guys at the loft that if they come by a junk tibook with intact hinges to let you know (kind of like your <a href="http://www.my-clean-teeth.com/site/2008/10/tooth-sealant.html" rel="nofollow">dentist appointments</a>!). Buy it from them for $10 and replace the hinges yourself. In the meantime, be gentle!<br/><br/>That laptop is definitely worth saving, but don't put any more money into it. You could probably buy a working used one for not much more than the hinge replacement would cost.

When I first got the machine, from my employer. I did some research on it to find out more about it. When I asked wikipedia, it warned me the hinge was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Quality_issues" rel="nofollow">congenital defect,</a> of this particular version. My last mac died from a congenital defect of the video card, so I was prepared for something like this to happen.

I'll be taking the machine to the local mac guys in Allston over at the <a href="http://www.computerloft.com/renderengine/templates/1112/default.asp" rel="nofollow">Computer Loft</a>. They are my go to guys when something Like this happens. I hope it doesn't cost too much to fix. It's not in critical condition. I can still use it. But I don't like opening and closing it because I have to lift that side of the monitor over the break. It's simply disconcerting, and I don't want to cause more damage to the machine.

Incidentally it was a bad day for the computer overall. About 5 minutes later the power source I was using stopped working. I was able to test and be sure it was my power source because my other friend sitting with me has the same kind of plug for her machine, and hers worked fine for me, but my plug did not work for her. I got a replacement charger for $35 including shipping. It's working right now, so that's one less thing to worry about.
