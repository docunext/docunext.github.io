I'm trying out anyterm 1.17. The demo is pretty cool, and the development version (the 1.1x branch) uses Sarissa, which I've been interested in for awhile.

What is anyterm? Its a browser based terminal, powered by apache, a special apache module, and ajax. Its not available on debian yet but the developer uses debian so it shouldn't be too hard to install.

UPDATE: I ended up installing Ajaxterm - it was easy to install and there was a debian package so I figured what the heck.
