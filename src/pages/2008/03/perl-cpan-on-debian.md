      I just noticed I had to install libextutils-xsbuilder-perl  using apt-get install when trying to force install Scalar::Util.

      Thanks so much, you saved me a lot of time!<br/>Documentation on Perl XS appears to be quite bad.<br/>Now I have XS version of Scalar::Util and I could get Net::SSLeay (1.35) installed by cpan.<br/>I needed that for having Net::SMTP::SSL installed, which in turn I needed to use Gmail SMTP server in Dada Mail (http://dadamailproject.com/).<br/><br/>So after:<br/><br/>apt-get install gcc libc6-dev openssl libssl-dev<br/><br/>(Maybe some of these isn't needed but I don't care now).<br/><br/>I could finally:<br/><br/>cpan -f Scalar::Util<br/><br/>How could I know that I needed gcc and something else to have the XS version of Scalar::Util?<br/><br/>Thanks again.

      Hi Kamal,<br/><br/>Glad I could help, and thanks for commenting.<br/><br/>On debian you can do "apt-get build-dep packagename" to install the stuff needed to build that package from source.<br/><br/>- Albert

You don't have the XS version of Scalar::Util

<pre>
cpan> force install Scalar::Util
</pre>

Again I am installing djabberd on debian via cpan, have to install make, gcc, libc6-dev, libxml2-dev, openssl, libssl-dev.

I couldn't get Net::SSLeay to install from CPAN, so I used libnet-ssleay-perl from debian.

UPDATE: See <a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/DJabberd_on_Debian">DJabberd on Debian</a>
