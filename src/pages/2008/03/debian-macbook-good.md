I'm very pleased with my new Macbook setup. I'm using Gnome and Openbox, Firefox 3 beta 4, madwifi with WPA supplicant, and everything is running smoothly. The only thing I'm without (that I've noticed so far) is Adobe Flash. I tried installing Gnash but it doesn't seem to be showing up. Finally just got suspend to work with s2ram (glad I'm using debian - for some reason <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2008/01/why-remove-s2ram/">Ubuntu removed s2ram</a>):

<pre>s2ram -f -p -m</pre>
