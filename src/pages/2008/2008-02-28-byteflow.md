      Hi sorry for the rejection. The comments plugin I am using is rubbish. Probably will move the blog to Django but that is a big job so will take a while.

      I know I'm late to the game in replying here, but I'd like to mention that byteflow is awesome!  I'm trying build awareness of it to help build a healthy contributer base.  I recently made the conversion and won't turn back.  Thanks for blogging about it!

I installed byteflow last night, and although I had some issues with url mapping, I finally got it to work. Its pretty cool - very much all about django, which is something I've been meaning to examine.

I posted a comment to Command Line Warriors but got rejected:

<blockquote>I finally tried out django with the byteflow blog engine. So far it seems logical. Now I'm going to start combing the code...</blockquote>
