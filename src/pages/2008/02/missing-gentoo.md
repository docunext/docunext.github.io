      Howdy Al,<br/><br/>I've been running Gentoo on my desktop @ home. More flexibility for me to optimize my machine with fairly recent versions of apps!<br/><br/>I'll shoot you an e-mail soon.. got busy again!<br/><br/>-Jay

      Hi Jay, Let's meet for food soon! And thanks for introducing me to Debian! :-)

My first introduction to linux was redhat, and then I switched to Windows 2000, then switched to Mac OS X with its BSD-ish core. During my time with Mac OS X, I used Gentoo for my servers. After struggling with upgrades, I decided to switch to Debian at the suggestion of a colleague.

I haven't looked back after switching to debian, but now that I'm using linux on the desktop, I'm wondering if I should give gentoo another chance. I find myself constantly wanting to optimize my computing experience!
