Bluefish as an editor is pretty good. Comparing it to jEdit, the two have the functionality I need:

* Remote filesystem browsing
* Element completion

However, Bluefish needs some work on the file browser. When browsing remote filesystems, its displaying files as folders, and the bookmarks appear to refer to spots in files rather than folders. I'd like to be able to quickly connect to a folder on a remote filesystem. In connecting, Bluefish is better since it can use the ssh-agent for sftp authentication.
