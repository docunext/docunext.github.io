      It's a little bit unfortunate that Debian MySQL Replication is quite rare and finding documentation for little issues/bugs/warnings can be quite a mission.

I finally nailed down a problem I've been having with MySQL replication on debian. I usually use tmpfs for /tmp, so when the machine restarts, /tmp is gone. That's why I call it tmp!

Anyway, to retain mysql stuff through a reboot, I use this:

<pre>tmpdir      = /var/lib/mysql/tmp</pre>
