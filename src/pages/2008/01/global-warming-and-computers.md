      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvdc" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvdc</a><br/>The above wikipedia page says that High Voltage DC has losses in the order of 3% per 1000Km.<br/><br/>The power wasted in transmission may be exceeded by the power used for cooling (which according to my best estimates may be more than 1/3 as much as the power used).<br/><br/>Of course if you get solar power for your entire building then it can run the computer and the cooler.<br/><br/><a href="http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/01/23/asus-eeepc-as-a-router/" rel="nofollow">http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/01/23/asus-eeepc-as-a-router/</a><br/>Have you considered using the EeePC (or a similar machine) as a router and small server?  It seems to have a lot of potential to save power for such uses.  One of my clients is investigating it at the moment (at my suggestion).

      I have! I use several Everex NC150x laptops as servers - they can use as little as 9 watts! They also have a hardware RNG and AES acceleration, so they are actually really up to the task of serving. Its funny but when I was searching for C7 machines, the laptops were the cheapest machine available (unfortunately they aren't too easy to find anymore), and with the ability to be a pretty useful "hand me down" computer, I couldn't resist. In the end I bought six of them and I'm really glad I did. Four of them came with Vista and I wish I could have bought them bare bones!<br/><br/>The only problem I find with the notebooks is that they only have one ethernet port. They have mini-PCI for a wifi card (they came with an Atheros card which I actually removed and am using in some pfSense firewalls), but 9 watts is too much for a wireless router IMHO.<br/><br/>I also have a couple HP t5135 machines which have a lower power C7, on of which I use as a PBX server with AskoziaPBX and the other as a debian based ejabberd server, but those consume 10 watts. Its very odd because the C7 in them is the "Eden" brand and only runs at 400Mhz, and they also have no screen nor hard drive. Go figure. Must be a kernel / ACPI optimization?

Its interested to note that there are a lot of computer companies making a concerted effort to reduce energy consumption, but how much energy do computers really use?

I can really only comment on personal and small business use of computers, and its not too too much. Its enough to encourage me turn off machines to save a few dollars a month, but compared to heat and air conditioning, its not too much, as far as I can tell. In addition to that, there is a significant expense in the transmission of electricity to my home and office, so even if a computer doesn't use that much power, there is also power consumed in getting the power there.

Since getting power to computers requires power, its another reason why I like the idea of solar powered computers. But the problem with that is that you'd of course need a power supply for the night time.
