Its funny, I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams - and my dreams are wild - that abstract notions could be carried through from a programming language to a program.

But, Trac definitely has some pythonic ideas - loosely coupled good ideas - suggestive ideas that don't force you into one way way of doing things, but suggest good ways of doing things.

No structure can be a challenge, too much structure can be stifling, suggestive structure is conducive. :-)
