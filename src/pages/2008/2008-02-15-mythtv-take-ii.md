      I'm really intrigued by the whole idea behind MythTV.  Let me know if you get it up and running, and how you're liking it.

I'm taking another stab at setting up MythTV. After setting up a laptop using the openchrome drivers, I remembered how much fun working with graphics can be. I found the via unichrome system to be fairly competent, so I'm using a VIA EN-12000EG mainboard with a Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250. From what I've read online, the card doesn't have the best support, but I'm only experimenting at this point.

#### WinTV PVR-250

The WinTV PVR-250 has MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 encoding support, but not decoding.

#### Via C7 1.2Ghz with VIA CN700+VT8237R Chipsets

Thankfully the VIA chipset I'm using - the Unichrome, has decoding capabilities: "Integrated UniChromeTM Pro AGP with MPEG-2 Acceleration". Despite the price (I think I paid around $200) its a nice little mainboard. It has GbE, ieee1394, 2 SATA ports, S-video out, RCA out, and doesn't use too much power. Silent too!
