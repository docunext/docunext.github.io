      I wish these were debian, but they are CentOS.

      Ah, OK. I just found this other post:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/07/14/aolserver4-nsmysql/" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/07/14/aolserver4-nsmysql/</a><br/><br/>And I'm posting the emails we exchanged in the wiki:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.docunext.com/wiki/The_Emails_Between_Dossy_and_I_about_AOLServer_and_MySQL" rel="nofollow">http://www.docunext.com/wiki/The_Emails_Between_Dossy_and_I_about_AOLServer_and_MySQL</a>

Finally figured this one out, I think. I was trying to compile aolserver4-nsmysql on debian, using the package source, but I kept hitting that error. then <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=218406">I found some bug about openSUSE related to this</a>, and the workaround for x86 was to do this:

<pre lang="bash">
ln -s /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so</pre>

DOH! Unfortunately, I'm back to square one. I'm now able to compile aolserver4-nsmysql, but I still get this error when trying to load the driver:

<pre lang="bash">
Warning: modload: could not load /usr/lib/aolserver4/bin/nsmysql.so: /usr/lib/aolserver4/lib/libnsmysql.so: undefined symbol: mysql_select_db</pre>

Maybe I'll stick with Postgres?

Dossy seems to be around still, so I've just sent an email:

<blockquote>

Hi Dossy,

How are you? I'm trying to get your AOL Server mysql driver up and running but keep running into the same problem:

Warning: modload: could not load /usr/lib/aolserver4/bin/nsmysql.so: /usr/lib/aolserver4/lib/libnsmysql.so: undefined symbol: mysql_select_db

I've been on this for a few days, I'm using debian lenny, and have /usr/lib/aolserver4/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/aolserver4.conf. I'm using the debian packages for aolserver4 and aolserver4-nsmysql, but since it didn't work like that, I've been trying to compile it myself.

First I ran into an issue where it couldn't find gcc_s, so I did this:

ln -s /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so /lib/libgcc_s.so

That helped the compile finish, but I still get the same error when starting AOL Server.

What do you think? Any ideas? Thanks!
