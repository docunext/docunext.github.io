      mod_perl chews up more memory per thread than I expected, as was pointed out to me during the preso.

      Hi Brian, Thanks for the follow-up. I've been noticing that too - it does like memory.<br/><br/>I'm definitely interested in trying out mod_lua. Its described as a very light and fast programming language. NICE!

Just tried to comment on <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/wombat/wombat_ac_us_07.html">Brian McCallister's blog about a comment he made about mod_perl not being as good as he thought it </a>was, but there was a problem posting the comment, so I'm just writing it here:

Can you explain the comment about mod_perl? I've been getting all excited about mod_perl lately, and how its able to work with the worker MPM. mod_wombat looks great by the way, I've been learning a little lua with mysql-proxy.
