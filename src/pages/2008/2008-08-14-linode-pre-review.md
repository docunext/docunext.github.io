In addition to <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/08/back-at-slicehost-review-2.html">Slicehost</a>, I've also signed up for a VPS with Linode. Their prices are just about the same, maybe a little better. They offer a more "a la carte" service menu, where you can adjust memory, storage and bandwidth to fit your specific needs.

In the two weeks I've used the service, I've had no problems.
