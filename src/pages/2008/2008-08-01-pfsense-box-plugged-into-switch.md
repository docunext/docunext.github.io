      On this box, its either a PC Engines WRAP or a PC Engines ALIX. They make great hardware. The WRAPs are no longer available (or in incredibly short supply) but the ALIX boards are available at good prices at a variety of online retailers.

Here's a picture of my pfSense box plugged into my switch. If I understand this correctly the switch is merely acting to complete a circuit for the pfSense box which wants to have both plugs filled.

The home router is the box on the bottom, while the pfSense box is in the middle, and the switch is on top.
