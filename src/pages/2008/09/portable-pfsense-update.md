title: Portable pfSense Update
date: 2008-09-10

Recently I blogged about <a href="http://www.docunext.com/2008/08/bringing-my-pfsense-firewall-along/">bringing my pfSense firewall along</a>, and while it was first a bit of a pain to use, its working really well now.

I'm still hoping to use one of the older, slower WRAP boards, but I keep running into issues with the pfSense CF card. I'm not sure if its caused by an incompatibility with pfSense and the WRAP, or I'm just getting bad luck with my CF cards. Hmmm. I might need to switch to m0n0wall at some point if the problems persist.

Today I was thinking of setting up a VOIP phone, but I am not able to setup a switch for the phone to be a part of the VPN - yet!
