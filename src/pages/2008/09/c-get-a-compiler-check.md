Well I finished the download/install of Xcode, and started the youtube tutorial. I'm going to have to find another tutorial, because the one I linked to is done entirely in Microsoft visual studio 6.0, which is only going to cause me agony to try and translate the instructions to the program I'm using. At the moment I'm a little overwhelmed by all the options simply to start a project. I'm going to have to read more, before I feel comfortable with what I'm doing.

I know the information is out there though, so It's just a matter of time to find it.
