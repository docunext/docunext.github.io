title: Empty Trash and SpamAssassing Integration

Couple of features I'd love to see in CircleBox / RoundCube:

* An empty trash button available on the main page - I use email as a notification system and end up throwing away a lot of mail. Currently I have to select the deleted messages folder, then empty it.

* A button for connecting with sa-learn and other spamassassin features - other uce controls as well?
