      Since you mentioned godaddy, I'll also provide some recent results for Godaddy coupon codes. I am a Web Content Site Developer, and these discounts come in very handy when purchasing or renewing a domain. Use Godaddy promo code ZINE3 for $7.49 .com domains and renewals. I save about $45 every time I purchase domains from godaddy.com. When I buy at least 5 domains, I also get free private registration when I use ZINE3. For other Godaddy coupons, use ZINE1 for 10% off, ZINE2 for $5 off any $30+ purchase, and ZINE25 for $25 off any purchase of $100 or greater, like hosting plans. These promo codes are current, working, and do not expire. Hope these Godaddy coupon codes save just as much dough for the other blog readers as they have for me. Take it easy!<br/>-Patrica from Cuba, AL.

Unfortunately, the great GoDaddy coupon codes (OYH3, emma3, chill3, etc.) which provided domains for $6.95 no longer work for me. Even the mediocre ones which provided domains for $7.49 are no longer working. Ugh.

So I did a little searching and found domainspricedright.com, which is godaddy in disguise, but which provides domains for $7.99. Its not bad, but certainly not great. :-(
