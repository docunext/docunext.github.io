I'm working on infrastructure stuff today - i.e. trying to <a href="http://www.docunext.com/blog/2008/04/13/to-do-list-bacula-and-ldap/">setup LDAP as I mentioned in a previous post</a>, among other things.

Some stuff I'd like: * A visual network map web app which shows all the servers on the network - something like nagios might work, even though that's a monitoring system
