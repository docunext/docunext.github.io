I had trouble tracking down the driver for this printer.  I'm not sure if this model was discontinued or what, but we had a hard time connecting it to the network and are still unable to do so, even with the driver, which I finally found <a href="http://www.samsung.com/download/FileView.aspx?cttfileid=163703&type=Printer&typecode=15&subtype=Laser+Printer&subtypecode=1501&model=ML-1740/TEC&filetype=DR&language=">here.</a>    This download is strictly for Win 98/ME/2K/XP OS
