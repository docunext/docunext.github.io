I'm trying out Xen finally, I just installed some packages:

<pre>apt-get install xen-hypervisor-3.0.3-1-i386 libc6-xen linux-image-xen-686 bridge-utils libsysfs2  xen-ioemu-3.0.3-1 </pre>

I'm using dev-3, a toshiba laptop. Darn, I just rebooted and I'm getting kernel panics. I'll have to save that for another day...
