I've been using Debian's MTOS for a client and so far it seems quite different than the versions that I've been basing Mutable Times off of. All in all, I *really* like MovableType, and I think its perfect for what my client is using it for, but there are still a bunch of things I want to modify.

I'd like to speed up performance to the database when the database is remote - as well as revisit the idea of having <a href="http://www.mutabletimes.docunext.com/mutabletimes/2008/07/rw-database-connections/">two different dsns for reading and writing to different database servers</a>.
