Being a fan of Apache, I've read the mod_rewrite guide a few times. Its very cool stuff, and allows you to do almost anything you want with URLs. If you've interacted with the rewriting capabilities of mod_rewrite, you know its raw power, and sometimes its capacity is overkill, and something more flexible is required.

Therein lies the concept of url routing. I'm not a fan of that name at all. Routing to me means defining connections between separate networks, but the name has stuck.

<h4><b>Frameworks that use Routing</b></h4>
Ruby on Rails and Symfony are two that I'm aware of, and I'm sure that there are many more. What I do like about the way they manage the routing specifications - in a configuration file. Symfony uses YAML, and while I prefer XML, the idea is the similar enough to give me a sense of like-mindedness.

<h4><b>Downfalls of Routing</b></h4>
Sometimes routing can actually obfuscate what's going on, that's why a lot of times I like to keep the url as the default query string parameters that are used by browsers and web servers by default on private applications.

<h4><b>Benefits of Routing</b></h4>
However, when it comes to public resources, the url can serve as another preview for users to see before visiting a website.

<h4><b>Routing with XSL</b></h4>
XSL isn't really designed for routing as far as I can tell, but it is possible to integrate a routing process into an XSL framework, like <a href="http://www.nexista.org/blog/">Nexista</a>.
