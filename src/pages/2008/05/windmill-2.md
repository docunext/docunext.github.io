      As I was explaining Windmill to Max, it seems like a full combination of the Selenium IDE, Selenium Core, and Selenium RC. Its a little more work to get going, but you get more control and capabilities in the end.

I finally tried out Windmill the other day, successfully recorded and ran a test, but I'm failing to see the value in it over selenium.

I like that it is written in python, but I'm not so crazy about how the tests are written in json.

I'm going to do some more digging, and I'll report back my findings.
