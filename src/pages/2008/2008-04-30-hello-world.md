      Why to create yet another Debian GNU/Linux based distribution just to have less packages?  I rather do not install the packages I am not interested in.<br/><br/>What it would be really interesting, from my point of view, would be a Debian GNU/Linux installer (alternative to the "official" one) which would run on less memory (even on 8-16MB) and which would install an smaller base system (something like 50-80MB) by not installing documentation and, maybe, some packages on the Debian official base system.

Debian has almost 20,000 packages in their repositories, but many of them do the same thing. I've been thinking about making a distribution that has a smaller subset of packages.
