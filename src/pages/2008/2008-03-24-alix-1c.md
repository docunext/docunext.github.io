      I also have an ALIX1C, and will probably be using it as a server as soon as I get it working properly. Have you gotten this board to boot Debian without a monitor attached?

      Hi Chris - absolutely! I had no problem at all to install debian onto a 2GB or so compact flash card and run the ALIX1c without a monitor.<br/><br/>Where are you in the process of setting up the ALIX1c? Are you using a solid state drive (compact flash, etc.) or a real hard drive?

I'm back installing debian on an ALIX1C - the lx800 wonder from PC Engines that uses only 5W of power! I'm using a compact flash disk as the hard drive and I'm planning to also use an NFS share for extra storage.
