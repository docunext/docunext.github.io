      I use jEdit too :) What are your feelings about XFCE vs Gnome?<br/><br/>P. S. I've postponed the dpkg-related stuff for a while.

      Hi Andrey! Well for low-power computers XFCE4 rocks, but I'm using Gnome on a computer with a decent graphics card and its working OK.

      Have you tried Bluefish? The gnome-vfs capability is really nice - single sign on with libpam-ssh!

Yay! I'm switching to using linux on a notebook! My Macbook has been acting erratic and before it goes I decided to switch to ubuntu / debian. Right now I'm typing on a debian-based laptop. It took me the past day and a half to get everything going, but I think it's boding well!

I actually built two - one has a dual boot: ubuntu gutsy and windows xp home. The other is the debian, built with a custom kernel. Both are running the xfce4 window manager. I've got wireless working on both too which is pretty awesome.

I'm able to run jEdit which is fantastic. I also installed dmz-cursor-theme, pidgin, and bluefish.

Thanks:
