      Hi!<br/>I am having some trouble with the newline character behind a button:<br/><br/>My test runs perfectly with Selenium IDE, but when i include it in a suite, it fails with "Element not found error", because it tries to find a text containig "\n" instead of<br/>Have you encountered such a situation? Is there any solution besides working with a button with no "newline" character behind?<br/>10x in advance

      Hi Alexandra,<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you mean by a newline character behind a button. Could you be more specific?<br/><br/>Have you tried putting "&lt;br /&gt;" in the test suite instead of "\n"?

      Hi ALbert!<br/>!0x for your quick answer.<br/>Yes i have tried putting .<br/>I included my code in the previous comment, but since it is html, it doesn't appear...<br/>The link that is behind my button is generated in such a manner that it contains a newline character:<br/>---input type="submit" onclick="enableUpdate(true);HERE IS A NEWLINE CH<br/>setFields('75','bearer6','','','[]','5',this.form); setAction('populate');" ---<br/>Run on its own from the IDE the character is interepreted as &gt;br/

      So the newline is in a bit of javascript code in an onclick attribute of the button element?<br/><br/>You could move the javascript code into a function somewhere else on the page, then not have a newline in the button...<br/><br/>Also, you could try using a character entity reference for the newline, which I believe is "&amp;#10;".

      Hello again!<br/>I don't have access to the code, nore the right to modify it... My boss asked for a solution that doesn't modify the code...<br/>I have finally made it by reffering to my button element through an xpath expression buitl differently tha the one Selenium IDE geenrated for me.<br/>I did that using Firebug-&gt;InspectElement-&gt;copy as xpath which gave a reference to my button that looks something like this: "//html/body/center/table/tbody/tr[3]/td/table/tbody/tr/td/div/div/form/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[6]/td/nobr/input".<br/>This does the trick for me! It now works in every way that I need it: as a suite inside the browser and in my Java test classes...<br/>thank you so much for your time!<br/>When i finish my task i will try your last hint and get back to you to tell you if it worked...<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Alexandra

I just had a tough time figuring out how to get a newline into a textarea with selenium core. It should have been obvious, but I was thinking too deep.

Selenium reads the HTML output, not the text of the source. So to create a newline for a textarea, you have to use &lt;br/&gt;!

This reminds me that the other day I tried creating a dynamic test with a PHP file and of course it worked fine. I should also be able to create the test with XSL, which would be terrific.
