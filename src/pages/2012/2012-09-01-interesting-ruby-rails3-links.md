      I think you need to brush up on concerns and do a presentation at DCRUG. (Yeah this is basically me asking you to do the research for me)

      I would love to do a presentation at DCRUG about concerns. I tinkered with ActiveSupport::Concern a bunch today and have only come to appreciate it more. Here's a quick example of a module I wrote that uses it. Its just a quick way to add some customizable functionality to ActiveRecord models (though of course ActiveSupport::Concern can be used for various other purposes).

There are a lot of interesting facets to Rails version 3+ that still have not come to the forefront - even though some folks are already using version 4-beta. Many of the facets involve the fact that engines are now "official", but there are a lot of other cool innovations, like concerns, route constraints, responders, and... oh where to stop?

I personally want to learn more about Rails 3 features:

* Concerns ( I know a little )
* Engines ( I know a decent amount )
* Responders ( I don't know enough )
* Initializers ( Not sure )

I had a nice weekend of software development, happened across these links, and found them useful:
